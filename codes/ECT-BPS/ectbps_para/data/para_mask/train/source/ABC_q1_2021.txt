beginning with our first quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-one, an increase of num-two%, primarily due to exceptional operating income growth across our businesses.
so i will now turn to our fiscal year-six guidance.
we delivered exceptional results driven by differentiated commercial solutions with revenues of $num-one billion for the first fiscal quarter, representing growth of num-two% year-over-year and our adjusted earnings per share increasing num-three% versus the prior year quarter.
all other financial guidance metrics for fiscal year-six remain unchanged.
