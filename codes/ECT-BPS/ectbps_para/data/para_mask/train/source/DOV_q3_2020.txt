as a result of our performance in the first three quarters of the year and a solid order backlog, we are raising our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance to $num-one to $num-two per share.
in summation, we're raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $num-one per share to $num-two per share for the full year, above the top end range of our prior guidance.
with strong margin performance to date, we intend to deliver approximately flat year-over-year adjusted margin this year, despite a lower revenue base.
fueling solutions remain constructive finishing the year and into year-six.
