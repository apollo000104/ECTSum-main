among them: a continued high level of consumer engagement that led to a second straight year of qtr-one profitability in the u.s. consumer segment, with strong momentum as we ended the calendar year; the announcement of a third pricing action in the consumer business that will take effect in the second half of the year; an increase in our full year sales guidance for the segment; some moderation, finally, in commodity prices; continued restrengthening of our supply chain and has us well positioned to meet the demands for the upcoming season; restructuring efforts in hawthorne that will make the business even stronger; and plenty of activity, including two more hawthorne acquisitions in what is the most robust m&a pipeline we've had in num-one years.
total company sales were down num-one%, against a num-two% comp a year ago.
adjusted earnings, which excludes restructuring, impairment, and nonrecurring charges, was a loss of $num-one, compared with earnings a year ago of $num-two.
on the bottom line, our seasonal loss on a gaap basis was $num-one a share, compared with income of $num-two last year.
as part of this restructuring effort, we're also closing the manufacturing facility for hydrologic, which we acquired last year.
the supply chain challenges we've mentioned previously are difficult to precisely quantify, but we believe they caused around num-one% of the downward pressure in the quarter.
we expect those actions to result in a restructuring charge of up to $num-one million in the second quarter.
