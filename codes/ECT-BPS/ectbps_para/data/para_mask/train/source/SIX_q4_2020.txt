revenue in the quarter was down $num-one million or num-two% to $num-three million as a result of a num-four% decline in attendance.
i would now like to give you an update on the progress of our transformation plan.
we expect to ramp up to the full amount of benefits as attendance grows to year-four levels.
we estimate that our net cash outflow in the first quarter of year-six will be higher than normal or approximately $num-one million to $num-two million per month.
we expect to maintain our annual capital expenditures at num-one% to num-two% of revenue.
in january alone, we realized more than $num-one million of fixed cost value due to transformation, so we are well on track to achieve our estimated savings for year-six.
