overall, when considering our strategic pricing actions, coupled with the solid volume growth in hhc, improved performance in construction adhesives and strong demand in engineering adhesives, we now expect full year revenue growth of high single digits to low double-digits versus year-five.
regarding our outlook, based on what we know today and the planning assumptions that jim laid out earlier, we anticipate revenue to be up high single-digits to low double-digits versus year-five and ebitda to be between $num-one million and $num-two million as continued strong volume growth and pricing actions offset higher raw material costs.
however, we now expect year-on-year raw material inflation to be in the range of num-one% to num-two%.
we expect cash flow to be strong for the rest of the year, allowing us to maintain our target to pay down approximately $num-one million of debt during year-six.
we will also deliver an additional $num-one million of debt reduction in year-six, moving the company closer to our net debt target of num-two to num-three times ebitda.
