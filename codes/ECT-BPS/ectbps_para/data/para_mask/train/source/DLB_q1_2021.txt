as lewis said, the environment remains challenging across the industry.
at that time, i said that for the first half of fy year-six, we were anticipating year-over-year growth in licensing revenue from higher adoption of dolby technologies, but we are also expecting year-over-year decline in products and services revenue because of the covid impact on the cinema industry.
today, our scenario is that qtr-two revenue could range from $num-one million to $num-two million.
i already highlighted the revenue range of $num-one million to $num-two million in total, of which licensing would comprise $num-three million to $num-four million, while products and services would comprise $num-five million to $num-six million.
so based on the combination of the factors i just covered, we estimate that qtr-two diluted earnings per share could range from $num-one to $num-two on a gaap basis, and from $num-three to $num-four on a non-gaap basis.
