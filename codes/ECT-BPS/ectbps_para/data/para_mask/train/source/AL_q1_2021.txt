for the first quarter of year-six, we are reporting $num-one million in total revenues and diluted earnings per share of $num-two a share, down num-three% and num-four%, respectively, compared to the prior year's prepandemic first quarter.
we also delivered our third num-one-num-two to cayman airways in the caribbean, the national flag carrier of cayman islands, which is retiring its last num-one-num-three aircraft and replacing it with our new num-one-num-two model, and the first of which, num-four num-one-num-two aircraft that we just delivered to blue air in romania.
however, we anticipate our overall sales in year-six will not reach prepandemic level.
