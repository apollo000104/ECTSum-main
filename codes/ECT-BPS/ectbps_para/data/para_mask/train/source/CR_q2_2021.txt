we finished the second quarter with record adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $num-one, up num-two% compared to last year and record adjusted operating margins of num-three%.
based on this performance, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance by $num-one to a range of $num-two to $num-three, which is effectively our fourth guidance increase so far this year.
as max explained, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $num-one to a range of $num-two to $num-three, reflecting the strong second quarter performance and our expectation that end markets and execution will be ahead of where we forecasted them earlier this year.
