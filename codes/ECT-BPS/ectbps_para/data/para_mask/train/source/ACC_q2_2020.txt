as we reported last night, total ffom for the second quarter of year-five was $num-one million or $num-two per fully diluted share.
this resulted in property same-store revenues decreasing by num-one% which we were able to partially offset with savings and operating expenses of num-two% for a combined noi decrease of num-three%.
we also have some additional anticipated refunds in our on-campus ace portfolio for the remainder of the summer term, expected to be in the range of approximately $num-one million to $num-two million, which should still keep us within the originally communicated range of expected refunds.
as of [date], we had over $num-one million of availability on our revolver, with no remaining debt maturities in year-five and a manageable $num-two million in secured mortgage debt maturing in year-six.
