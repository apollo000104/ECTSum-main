our third quarter gaap diluted earnings per share was $num-one, included in these results are approximately $num-two per share of divestiture costs and the cost of the operational improvement plan.
the adjusted results for year-six and year-five remove the impact of the divestiture-related costs, the operations divested and the impact of the costs related to our operational improvement plan.
we now expect our full year year-six adjusted local currency revenue to grow at a high single digit rate, which is up from our previous guidance of a mid single digit growth rate.
