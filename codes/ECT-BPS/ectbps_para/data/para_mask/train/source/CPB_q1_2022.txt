adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $num-one or num-two% versus prior year to $num-three per share, but remains well ahead of fiscal year-five.
this resulted in better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share of $num-one, which was down $num-two per share, compared to the prior year.

this resulted in better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share of $num-one, which was down $num-two per share, compared to the prior year.
given our solid first quarter results and their consistency with our expectation [technical issues] our full-year guidance.
organic net sales were down num-one% for the quarter, driven by the expected lapping of prior year retailer inventory replenishment, as well as constrained supply in the current quarter.
organic net sales were, down num-one%, primarily due to labor-related supply constraints, but grew num-two%, compared to fiscal year-five, in-market performance was strong growing num-three% over the prior year quarter and num-four% on a two-year basis.
for the first quarter as we left num-one% growth in the prior-year, organic net sales declined num-two%, due to the anticipated cycling of year ago retailer inventory recovery and supply pressures.
organic net sales decreased num-one% during the quarter, driven by a num-two point volume headwind, which reflects lapping of the prior year retailer inventory recovery and the before mentioned supply constraints.
favorable price and sales allowances drove a num-one point gain in the quarter, which was partially offset by a num-two point headwind due to some spend back on promotional spending in the quarter closer to pre-pandemic levels.
all in our reported net sales declined num-one% from the prior year.
adjusted ebit of minus num-one% to minus num-two% and adjusted earnings per share of minus num-three% to flat versus the adjusted fiscal year-six results.
we see pace continuing to improve throughout the year.
we expect this to be evident, particularly through the second quarter as we cycle through recovery on labor and supply.
we have achieved $num-one million in incremental year-over-year savings and remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $num-two million by the end of fiscal year.
