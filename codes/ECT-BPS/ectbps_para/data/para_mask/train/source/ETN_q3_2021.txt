supply chain constraints did have an impact on our revenue, but we still posted num-one% growth in the quarter.
revenues were up num-one%, including num-two% organic and num-three% from the acquisition of tripp lite.
when you add the two together, they delivered solid organic growth of num-one%, built a sizable backlog, which strengthens our outlook for future quarters and they improved margins by num-two basis points.
and lastly, our qtr-four guidance includes earnings between $num-one and $num-two, organic revenue growth between num-three% and num-four%, and segment margins between num-five% and num-six%, an increase of num-seven basis points at the midpoint versus prior year.
