earlier today we announced year-five fourth quarter earnings of $num-one per share.
similar to inland, we expect coastal market conditions will improve as the year progresses, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of year-six.
in the near-term, we expect tough market conditions to persist into the second quarter particularly in marine transportation where industry barge utilization is very low and we are experiencing very competitive pricing dynamics.
