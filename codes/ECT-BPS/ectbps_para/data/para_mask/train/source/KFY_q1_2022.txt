our strategy and efforts are clearly yielding results as we delivered a num-one% increase in fee revenue with really strong profitability, earnings per share of $num-two and an adjusted ebitda margin of num-three%, and these results are the continuation of our momentum over recent quarters and our performance speaks to our agility and importantly to the purpose for decisions and deliberate actions we've taken not only over the last few quarters but over the last several years, and now they've come together in a critical mass of opportunity.
fully diluted earnings per share also reached a record level in the first quarter, improving to $num-one, which was up from $num-two compared to adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal year-six and up $num-three or num-four% sequentially.
now assuming no major delta variant related lockdowns or changes in worldwide economic conditions, financial markets or foreign exchange rates, we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year-seven to range from $num-one million to $num-two million and our consolidated diluted earnings per share to range from $num-three to $num-four.
