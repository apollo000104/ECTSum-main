the improvements we made to our business model combined with fourth quarter sales accelerating faster than cost grows strong profitability, resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $num-one.
based on these assumptions, we expect total sales of $num-one billion to $num-two billion, representing growth of num-three% to num-four% from pre-covid levels, same restaurant sales growth of num-five% to num-six% and num-seven to num-eight new restaurants.
going forward, we will be referencing industry data provided by technomic which sizes the casual dining and fine dining categories for fiscal year-five at $num-one billion and for fiscal year-four at $num-two billion.
based on these assumptions, we expect total sales of $num-one billion to $num-two billion, representing growth of num-three% to num-four% from pre-covid levels, same restaurant sales growth of num-five% to num-six% and num-seven to num-eight new restaurants.
all resulting in a diluted net earnings per share between $num-one and $num-two.
total sales for the fourth quarter were $num-one billion, num-two% higher than last year, driven by num-three% same restaurant sales growth and the addition of num-four net new restaurants, partially offset by one less week of operations this year. off-premise sales accounted for num-five% of total sales at olive garden, num-six% at longhorn and num-seven% at cheddar's scratch kitchen.
