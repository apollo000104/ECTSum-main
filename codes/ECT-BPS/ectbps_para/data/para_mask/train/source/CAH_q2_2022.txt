the net result for the quarter was earnings per share of $num-one.
beginning with total company results; first quarter revenue increased num-one% to $num-two billion, driven by sales growth from existing customers.
we are taking action to mitigate these impacts across the enterprise and we are reaffirming our fy year-seven earnings per share guidance of $num-one to $num-two per share.
we are reiterating our earnings per share guidance range of $num-one to $num-two per share.
and as noted last quarter, we still expect the cadence of our earnings per share guidance to be significantly back half-weighted.
and with our improved balance sheet, commitment to our dividend and now an additional $num-one billion share repurchase authorization, we're positioned to return capital to shareholders.
our board recently approved a new three year authorization to repurchase up to an additional $num-one billion of our common stock, expiring at the end of calendar year year-nine.
these expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segments, our commitment to our dividend and our new $num-one billion share repurchase authorization.
given the anticipated timing of realizing these cost increases and our mitigating actions, as well as the timing of selling higher-cost ppe, we expect a sequential decline in medical segment profit in the second quarter.
