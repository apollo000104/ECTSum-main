as you may recall, we indicated we expected to invest between $num-one million and $num-two million of capex back into the business following the onset of the pandemic.
as part of this program, we intend to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for $num-one million in the coming days.
this follows the num-one basis points and num-two basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, delivered by issuer and business and consumer respectively in year-five.
we currently expect net interest expense to be slightly lower in year-six relative to year-five, while we anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be relatively consistent with last year and expect our capital expenditures for year-six to be in the $num-one million to $num-two million range.
