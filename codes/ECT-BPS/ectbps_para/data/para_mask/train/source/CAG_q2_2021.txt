we delivered organic net sales growth of num-one%, adjusted operating margin of num-two%, and adjusted earnings per share of $num-three.
and our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew num-one% to $num-two for the second quarter.
eps increased num-one% to $num-two.
given these sales and margin factors along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third-quarter adjusted earnings per share in the range of $num-one to $num-two.
lastly, we are reaffirming all metrics of our fiscal year-seven guidance which also excludes the impact of the pending sale of peter pan.
given these sales and margin factors along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third-quarter adjusted earnings per share in the range of $num-one to $num-two.
for the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus num-one% to num-two%.
we do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year.
