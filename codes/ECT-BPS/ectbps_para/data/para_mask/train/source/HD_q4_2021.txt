and finally, during fiscal year-six, we returned approximately $num-one billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, including $num-two billion in the fourth quarter.
approximately num-one years ago, we pivoted from new stores as a driver of growth to growth driven by productivity.
our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $num-one, an increase of num-two% compared to the fourth quarter of year-five.
sales for the fourth quarter grew approximately $num-one billion to $num-two billion, up num-three% from last year.
in the fourth quarter, total sales were $num-one billion, an increase of approximately $num-two billion or num-three% -- num-four% from last year.
we adjust this dollar run rate for our historical seasonality to calculate our sales outlook for year-seven.
based on this approach and assuming there are no material shifts in demand, we calculate that sales growth and comp sales growth will be slightly positive for fiscal year-seven.
we expect our year-seven operating margin to be flat to year-six.
comps of positive num-one%.
were positive num-one% for the quarter with positive comps of num-two% in november, num-three% in december, and num-four% in january.
our total company comps were positive num-one% for the quarter with positive comps of num-two% in november, num-three% in december, and num-four% in january.
and we would expect low single-digit percentage growth in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal year-six.
and today, we announced our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by num-one% to $num-two per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $num-three.
