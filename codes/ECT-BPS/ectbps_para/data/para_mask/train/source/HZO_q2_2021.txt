accordingly, we are raising our earnings per share guidance to the range of $num-one to $num-two for year-six from $num-three to $num-four that we guided to after the december quarter.
for the quarter, revenue grew num-one% to over $num-two million due largely to same-store sales growth of num-three%.
the record sales and earnings growth we delivered were driven by robust num-one% same-store sales growth, which is on top of num-two% same-store sales growth a year ago.
in the quarter, the margin expansion and generally good expense control led to operating leverage of num-one% and the record earnings and earnings per share of $num-two.
our record march quarter saw both net income and earnings per share rise more than seven-fold, generating $num-one in earnings per share versus $num-two a year ago.
