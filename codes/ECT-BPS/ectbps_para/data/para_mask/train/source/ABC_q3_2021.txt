we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-one, an increase of num-two%, which was driven by the continued strong performance across amerisourcebergen's businesses and also benefited from the one month contribution from the alliance healthcare acquisition.
given the continued strong performance of amerisourcebergen's businesses, we are again raising our earnings per share guidance from a range of $num-one to $num-two, up to a range of $num-three to $num-four, reflecting growth of num-five% to num-six% from the previous fiscal year.
our consolidated revenue was $num-one billion, up num-two%, driven by revenue growth in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and other, which includes alliance healthcare and our global commercialization services and animal health businesses.
finally, turning to free cash flow, we have raised our free cash flow guidance to be approximately $num-one billion, up from approximately $num-two billion.
