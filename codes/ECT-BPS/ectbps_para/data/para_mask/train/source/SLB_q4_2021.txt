fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $num-one.
pretax operating margins improved num-one basis points sequentially to num-two% and have increased for six quarters in a row.
all divisions posted sequential growth, led by digital and integration.
from a geographical perspective, international revenue grew num-one%, while north america grew num-two%.
in essence, year-seven will be a period of stronger short-cycle activity resurgence driven by improved visibility in the demand recovery and greater confidence in the oil price environment.
and as oil demand exceeds prepandemic levels in year-eight and beyond, long cycle development will augment capital spending growth in response to the current supply.
in this scenario, increased activity and pricing will drive simultaneous double-digit growth both internationally and in north america that will lead our overall year-seven revenue growth to reach mid-teens.
