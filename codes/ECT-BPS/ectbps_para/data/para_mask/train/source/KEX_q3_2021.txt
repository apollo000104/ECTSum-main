earlier today, we announced adjusted earnings of $num-one per share for the year-six third quarter, which excludes a onetime noncash charge totaling $num-two per share related to our coastal marine business.
on a gaap basis, we reported a net loss of $num-one per share.
for the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $num-one million to $num-two million, which represents more than a num-three% reduction compared to year-five and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet.
