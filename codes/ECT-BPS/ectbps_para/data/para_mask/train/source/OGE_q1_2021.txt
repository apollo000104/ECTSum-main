earlier, we reported first quarter consolidated earnings of $num-one per share, which includes utility earnings of $num-two per share, earnings associated with our investment in enable of $num-three per share, and earnings at the holding company of $num-four per share.
we've made outstanding progress in the quarter toward mitigating the aforementioned gfb program impacts and currently project og&e full year year-six results within the lower half of our original guidance range of $num-one and to $num-two per share.
at the utility, og&e's first quarter results were $num-one lower than year-five, primarily driven by the previously disclosed losses that occurred during the extreme winter weather from the guaranteed flat bill program.
thus, our current estimate of year-six full year earnings per share is back in the lower half of guidance with three quarters in front of us.
