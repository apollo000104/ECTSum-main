additionally, we anticipate a significant year-over-year increase in expense due to continued higher tv production expenses at wwe's thunderdome as well as the return of employees from furlough.
we estimate that wwe can achieve year-six adjusted oibda of $num-one million to $num-two million as revenue growth driven by the peacock transaction, the gradual ramp-up of ticketed live events, including large-scale international events, and the escalation of core content rights fees is offset by the increase in production and personnel expenses.
in our view, the stated year-six adjusted oibda guidance range will be approximately num-one% to num-two% higher without the ongoing impact of covid, which includes the loss of ticket and merchandise sales of live events and the increased investment in production to further fan engagement.
given increasing visibility regarding wwe's projected performance and liquidity, we are planning to restart this project in the second half of year-six.
and as such, we are not reinstating more specific quarterly guidance at this time.
the timing and rate of returning ticketed audiences to wwe's live events remains subject to significant uncertainty.
certainly, the contractual escalation of wwe's core content rights fees will continue to be an important source of growth.
as of [date], year-five, wwe held $num-one million in cash and short-term investments.
