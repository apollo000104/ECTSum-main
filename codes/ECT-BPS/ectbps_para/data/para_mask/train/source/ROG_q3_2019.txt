gaap earnings per share of $num-one per fully diluted share and adjusted earnings per share of $num-two per fully diluted share for qtr-three year-four were above the upper end of our guidance range for qtr-three but below qtr-two levels.
gaap earnings per share of $num-one per fully diluted share and adjusted earnings per share of $num-two per fully diluted share for qtr-three year-four were above the upper end of our guidance range for qtr-three but below qtr-two levels.
in addition ongoing trade tensions are generating headwinds and in some cases limiting near-term demand visibility from a market perspective industrial and conventional automotive demand which had begun to slow in late qtr-two weakened further in the third quarter.
based upon customer and industry analyst inputs we expect the recent pause in the num-txt rollout to continue through the end of the year and believe that china num-txt deployments will rebound in the first half of year-five.
therefore revenues for qtr-four are estimated to be in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million.
as a result we guided gaap qtr-four loss in the range of $num-one to $num-two per share.
on an adjusted basis we guide the fully diluted earnings in the range of $num-one to $num-two per share for the fourth quarter.
