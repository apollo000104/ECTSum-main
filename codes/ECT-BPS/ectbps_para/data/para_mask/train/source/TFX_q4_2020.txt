on the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share was $num-one.
fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share declined modestly to $num-one from $num-two.
quarter four revenues totaled $num-one million, which represents an increase of num-two% as compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis.
despite several headwinds, our adjusted earnings per share outlook of $num-one to $num-two is robust, representing growth of between num-three% and num-four% versus year-five.
as a result, we expect our as-reported revenue to increase between num-one% in num-two% over year-five and this would equate to $num-three range of between $num-four million and $num-five million.
