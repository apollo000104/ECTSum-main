we now expect year-six full-year adjusted earnings of at least $num-one per share, representing growth of at least num-two% from year-five consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth rate range of num-two% to num-three%, and we expect to grow year-seven adjusted earnings per share at least num-two% off our raised year-six guidance.
