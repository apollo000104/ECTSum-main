remarkably, we delivered an num-one% sales increase versus last year and num-two% versus year-four.
total third quarter sales grew num-one% from the year-ago period or num-two% in constant currency.
sales and adjusted operating income are up num-one% and num-two% year-over-year respectively, both of which include a num-three% favorable impact from currency and we've grown adjusted earnings per share of num-four%.
turning to our flavor solutions segment and slide-num, we grew third quarter constant currency sales num-one%, including an num-two% increase from our fona and cholula acquisitions.
in the asia pacific region, flavor solutions sales rose num-one% in constant currency versus last year and increased num-two% in constant currency versus the third quarter of year-four, was driven by qsr growth and partially impacted by the timing of our customers limited time offers and promotional activities.
at the topline, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum, we now expect to grow constant currency sales num-one% to num-two%, which is the high end of our previous projection of num-three% to num-two%, and includes a num-four% incremental impact from the cholula and fona acquisitions.
our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions projected to be num-one% to num-two% constant currency growth, which includes the higher inflation ahead of pricing and logistics challenges and partially offset by a num-three% reduction from increased covid costs compared to year-five and a num-four% reduction from the estimated incremental erp investment.
this compares to $num-one of adjusted earnings per share in year-five and represents num-two% to num-three% growth in constant currency from our strong base business and acquisition performance, partially offset by the impacts related to covid costs, our incremental erp investment and the tax headwind.
on the bottom line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $num-one compared to $num-two in the year-ago period, driven by higher sales and a lower tax rate, partially offset by cost pressures.
at the bottom line, as shown on slide-num, third quarter year-six adjusted earnings per share was $num-one compared to $num-two for the year-ago period.
our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in year-six is now $num-one to $num-two.
