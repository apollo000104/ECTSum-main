looking forward, we expect full-year year-seven reported average loan balances to grow num-one% to num-two% compared to year-six.
salaries and benefits increased num-one%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation.
we expect year-seven adjusted noninterest expenses to be up num-one% to num-two% compared to year-six.
