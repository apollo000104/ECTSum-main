yesterday, we reported record earnings of $num-one per share compared with $num-two in the prior year's quarter and $num-three sequentially.
total assets under management was a record $num-one billion at june num-txth, an increase of $num-two billion or num-three% from march num-txtt.
the increase was due to net inflows of $num-one billion and market appreciation of $num-two billion, partially offset by distributions of $num-three million.
we believe our strong brand and investment performance have put us in a unique position to capitalize on these trends as evidenced by our $num-one billion in net inflows and the num-two% organic growth in this latest quarter.
