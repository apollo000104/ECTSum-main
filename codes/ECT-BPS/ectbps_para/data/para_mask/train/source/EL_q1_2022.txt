for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow num-one to num-two%.
diluted earnings per share of $num-one increased num-two% compared to the prior year.
notably, our earnings per share forecast also reflects a num-one% tax rate, compared to num-two% in the prior year when we benefited from certain one-time items.
our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for global prestige beauty and our company is reflected in the announcement today to raise the quarterly dividend.
this is causing us to experience inflation in freight and procurement, which we expect to impact our cost of goods and operating expenses beginning next quarter.
