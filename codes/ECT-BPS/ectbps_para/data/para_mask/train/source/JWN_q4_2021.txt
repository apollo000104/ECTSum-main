given solid top line growth, coupled with progress on our productivity initiatives, we expect diluted earnings per share of $num-one to $num-two for the year, which excludes the impact of share repurchases, if any.
with regard to increasing our digital velocity, we maintained strong growth at nordstrom.com and nordstromrack.com this quarter with digital sales increasing num-one% over the fourth quarter of year-four.
in qtr-four, we improved our in-stock position at the rack by increasing the flow of inventory, making more frequent deliveries to our stores, partnering with brands to prioritize rack deliveries and focusing our sourcing efforts on core categories that matter most to customers such as shoes and apparel.
as a result, our ending inventory was higher than planned but we expect to cut our sales to inventory spread in half by the end of the first quarter.
subject to completion of our year-end audit and the related certification process with our bank group, we expect to be in a position to resume returning cash to shareholders in the first quarter.
we expect ebit margin of approximately num-one to num-two% for the full year.
for the fiscal year year-seven, we expect revenue growth of num-one% to num-two%.
