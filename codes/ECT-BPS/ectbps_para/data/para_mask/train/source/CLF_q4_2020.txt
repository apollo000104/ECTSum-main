we expect to more than double this amount in the first quarter with total shipments of approximately num-one million net tons.
going forward, our external pellet sales volume should be num-one million to num-two million long tons per year, with the remainder of our output being used internally by our blast furnaces and direct reduction facility.
this is included in our num-one million to num-two million capital budget for year-six, which includes about num-three million in sustaining capex, as well as other small projects such as the new precision partners plant in tennessee, walking beam furnaces at burns harbor, and the powerhouse at cleveland works.
