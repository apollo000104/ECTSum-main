in fact, we currently have more than num-one restaurants under construction, and while timing is somewhat unpredictable, this gives us confidence in ending the year at or slightly above the num-two new restaurants with now more than num-three% including a chipotlane versus our prior expectation of num-four%.
for qtr-four, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the num-one% to num-two% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.
