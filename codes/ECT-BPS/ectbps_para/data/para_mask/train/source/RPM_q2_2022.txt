adjusted earnings per share was $num-one decreasing num-two% compared to the strong adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of nearly num-three% in the prior-year period.
for the fiscal year-seven second quarter, consolidated sales increased num-one% to $num-two billion driven by continued robust demand for paints, coatings, sealants, and other building materials.
in spite of these challenges, we expect to generate double-digit consolidated sales growth in the fiscal year-seven third quarter versus last year's record third quarter sales, which increased num-one%.
we anticipate that earnings will be affected by ongoing raw material, freight, and wage inflation, as well as the impact of raw materials shortages, on sales volume, plus the renewed covid disruption from the surging omicron variant.
