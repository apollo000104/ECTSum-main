and during the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately num-one basis points leading to diluted earnings per share of $num-two, which is a num-three% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year.
in qtr-two, we generated diluted earnings per share of $num-one, an increase of num-two% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year.

u.s. comparable sales were down num-one% in the second quarter but up num-two% on a two year basis.
comp sales were down num-one% in the quarter but up num-two% on a two year basis.
furthermore, we expect to execute a minimum of $num-one billion in share repurchases.
now, in this revised scenario, we expect lowe's to deliver sales of approximately $num-one billion for the year, representing two year comparable sales growth of approximately num-two%.
together, these expenses represent num-one basis points of operating margin deleverage relative to the $num-two billion revenue outlook.
