on the bottom line, we expect fourth quarter non-gaap diluted earnings per share in the range of $num-one to $num-two, in line with current consensus.
now let's look at our third quarter results, starting with our market share performance.
our third quarter organic revenue increased num-one%.
assuming that holds, for the fourth quarter, we're comfortable with current street consensus for our organic revenue growth of approximately num-one%.
in our structural heart and aortic business, we lost share in aortic due to supply constraints and continued pressure from our valiant navion recall and competitive launches.
while we were tracking to our quarterly guidance in early january, the impacts from this latest wave of covid affected our revenue in the last month of the quarter.
we'll then submit the data to the fda as on med is the final piece of our submission to seek approval for symplicity.
