on a gaap basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $num-one per share and included $num-two of acquisition accounting adjustments and net significant and/or nonrecurring items.
sales were $num-one billion, which was at the high end of our outlook range and up num-two% organically versus prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis and up num-three% sequentially.
so given our performance year-to-date and the recent trends across our end markets, we're going to raise the low end of our full year sales outlook by $num-one million to a new range of $num-two billion to $num-three billion.
