today, we reported fourth quarter total revenue of $num-one billion, an increase of num-two% year over year, driven by impressive growth in used vehicles of num-three% as well as double-digit growth in both customer financial services and aftersales.
today, we reported fourth quarter total revenue of $num-one billion, an increase of num-two% year over year, driven by impressive growth in used vehicles of num-three% as well as double-digit growth in both customer financial services and aftersales.
and as a result, used vehicle revenue increased num-one% for the quarter. this was partially offset by a num-two% decline in new vehicle revenue due to the continuing supply chain disruption to new vehicles production.
i think demand for vehicles continues to be strong.
