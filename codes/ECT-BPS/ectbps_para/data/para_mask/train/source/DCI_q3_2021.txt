given the strong results we experienced and our visibility into the remainder of fiscal year, we expect full year sales will be up num-one% to num-two% year-over-year versus our prior guidance of num-three% to num-four% increase.
we also plan to repurchase num-one% to num-two% of our shares outstanding.
the sales momentum we're currently experiencing is likely to carry through to the first half of fiscal year-seven.
capital expenditures are planned to be in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million.
