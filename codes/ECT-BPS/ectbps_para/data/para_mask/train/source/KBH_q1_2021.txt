in the first quarter our housing revenues of $num-one billion rose num-two% from a year ago, reflecting increases in both homes delivered and the overall average selling price of those homes.
in addition, strong net orders in the quarter combined with our substantial beginning backlog resulted in a num-one% year-over-year increase in our quarter-end backlog value supporting our raised revenue and margin outlook for year-six.
net orders in the first quarter grew num-one% year-over-year to nearly num-two, a solid result given the strength in net orders that we experienced in the prior year's first quarter.
