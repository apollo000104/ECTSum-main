we are revising our revenue range to $num-one million to $num-two billion, which reflects approximately $num-three million in revenue deferral from year-six to year-seven due to the current supply chain challenges.
accordingly, we are revising our adjusted ebitda outlook by approximately $num-one million to a range of $num-two million to $num-three million taking into account the gross margin associated with the aforementioned revenue deferral and an incremental $num-four million for supply chain related inflation over previous estimates.
