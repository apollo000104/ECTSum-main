and the cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong, increasing num-one% to $num-two million in the first quarter of fiscal year-six, and that was up from $num-three million in the first quarter of fiscal year-five.
as we mentioned earlier, cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong and increased num-one% to $num-two million in the first quarter of fiscal year-six, up from $num-three million in the first quarter of fiscal year-five.
