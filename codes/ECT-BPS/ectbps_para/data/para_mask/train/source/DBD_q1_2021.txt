in the first quarter, we delivered num-one% revenue growth underpinned by market share gains in atms and self-checkout solutions.
i'll provide additional color about key market trends in just a minute, but i'll simply say that our growth in qtr-one gives us the confidence to reiterate our year-six revenue outlook of $num-one billion to $num-two billion.
adjusted ebitda of $num-one million was the highest first quarter in the company's history and while jeff will discuss the details, i'm especially pleased that our operating profit growth of num-two% and adjusted ebitda growth of num-three% significantly outpaced our top line growth of num-four%.
adjusted for foreign currency and divestitures, revenue increased num-one% led by product growth of num-two%, software growth of num-three%, and a services decline of num-four%.
we expect to generate revenue of $num-one billion to $num-two billion, which equates to num-three% to num-four% annual growth.
