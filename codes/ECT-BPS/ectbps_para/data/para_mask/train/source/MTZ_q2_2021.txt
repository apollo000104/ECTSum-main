we project annual year-six revenue of $num-one billion with adjusted ebitda of $num-two million, or num-three% of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings of $num-four per share.
our current view represents a slight decrease in the annual year-six revenue expectation, primarily due to some project activity slippage to year-seven in communications and clean energy, while reaffirming the annual adjusted ebitda view of $num-one million, and increasing our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $num-two to $num-three per share.
our third quarter revenue expectation is $num-one billion with adjusted ebitda of $num-two million or num-three% of revenue and earnings guidance at $num-four per adjusted diluted share.
