despite the increased turnover rate, our subsidiaries has done an excellent job controlling inventory levels in the first six months of fiscal year-six, and we believe that's appropriate to support expected future net sales as well as our increased backlog as of [date], year-six, which increased by $num-one million to $num-two million.
consolidated net income per diluted share was $num-one in the second quarter of fiscal year-six, as compared to $num-two in the second quarter of fiscal year-five.
given those uncertainties, we cannot provide fiscal year-six net sales and earnings guidance at this time.
