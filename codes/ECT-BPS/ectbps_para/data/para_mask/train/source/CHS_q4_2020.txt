net sales totaled $num-one million compared to $num-two million last year.
we ended the year with inventories down over num-one% from the prior fiscal year-end. this $num-two million represented about num-three% of our annual rent expense, which we felt was a reasonable request at the time.
and we navigated the fourth quarter without increasing debt levels on our newly amended credit facility, which matures in october year-ten.
this num-one% decrease reflects a comparable sales decline of num-two% as well as the impact of num-three net store closures in the year, partially offset by a double-digit growth in digital sales.
