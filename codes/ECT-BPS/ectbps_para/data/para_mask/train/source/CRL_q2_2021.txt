quarterly revenue surpassed $num-one million for the first time and a $num-two million in the second quarter of year-six, represented a num-three% increase over last year.
earnings per share were $num-one in the second quarter, an increase of num-two% from $num-three in the second quarter of last year.
organic revenue growth of num-one%, including num-two% related to last year's covid impact and operating margin expansion of num-three basis points, were the primary drivers behind earnings-per-share growth share growth of num-four% to $num-five.
based on the second quarter performance and our expectation for sustained demand through the remainder of the year, we are increasing our revenue growth and non-gaap earnings per share guidance for year-six.
we now expect organic revenue growth in a range of num-one% to num-two%, num-three basis point increase from our prior range.
based on our strong second quarter results and expectations for the underlying strength of demand to continue, we have increased our full year financial guidance and now expect to deliver organic revenue growth in a range of num-one% to num-two% for the full year.
non-gaap earnings per share are expected to be in the range from $num-one to $num-two, which represents num-three% to num-four% year-over-year growth and an increase of $num-five at midpoint from our prior outlook.
primarily as a result of the enhanced growth prospects this year, and to a lesser extent, a favorable tax rate, we raised our earnings per share guidance by $num-one to a range of $num-two to $num-three, which represents year-over-year growth of num-four% to num-five%.
