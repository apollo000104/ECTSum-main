pricing power expanded gross margin and improved overhead leverage, combined with lower outstanding share count, all led to the num-one% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share to $num-two.
given the long-range cycle times, our fourth quarter closings totaled num-one homes, which was down num-two% over the challenging comps of prior year.
total orders of num-one for the fourth quarter of year-six reflected an increase of num-two% year over year, driven by a num-three% increase in average active community count, which was partially offset by the decrease in average absorptions.
the num-one% year-over-year home closing revenue growth to $num-two billion in the fourth quarter of year-six was a result of a num-three% increase in asp due to strong market demand, even as we shifted our product mix toward entry-level homes.
we are already seeing increased volume from our higher community count and expect to continue to benefit from incremental orders and closings in year-seven and beyond.
for the full year year-seven, we're projecting total closings to be between num-one and num-two units, home closing revenue of $num-three billion to $num-four billion, home closing gross margin around num-five%, an effective tax rate of about num-six%, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $num-seven to $num-eight.
