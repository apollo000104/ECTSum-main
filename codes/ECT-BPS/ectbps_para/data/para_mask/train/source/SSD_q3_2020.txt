we delivered strong third quarter results with our sales increasing num-one% year-over-year to $num-two million on significantly higher volume.
as karen highlighted, our consolidated sales were strong, increasing num-one% to $num-two million.
the strength in our gross profit margin combined with our efforts in expense management and reduced cost from travel and other restrictions, as a result of the covid helped drive a num-one% year-over-year increase in our income from operations to $num-two million and strong earnings of $num-three per diluted share.
accordingly, net income totaled $num-one million or $num-two per fully diluted share compared to $num-three million or $num-four per fully diluted share.
our sales were further supported by strong us housing starts in year-five.
