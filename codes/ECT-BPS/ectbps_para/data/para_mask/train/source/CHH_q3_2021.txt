and as a result, our adjusted earnings per share were $num-one in for the third quarter, an increase of num-two% versus year-four.
today, our gross debt-to-ebitda leverage levels remains at the low end of our target range of three to num-one times.
more specifically, at the end of the third quarter of year-six, the company had over $num-one billion in cash and available borrowing capacity through its revolving credit facility.
we currently expect full year domestic revpar to surpass year-four levels and grow at approximately num-one% as compared to full year year-four.
assuming the broader revpar and economy recovery trends continue, we now expect to see our year-six adjusted ebitda exceed year-four levels and range between $num-one million and $num-two million, even with planned incremental investments in the fourth quarter.
