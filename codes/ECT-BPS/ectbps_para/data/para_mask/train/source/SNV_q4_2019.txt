i'm also pleased to report that our board approved a num-one% increase in the quarterly dividend to $num-two per share of common stock effective with the [date] dividend.
these reductions were achieved with a net charge off ratio of num-one basis points for the quarter.
given our current profile of loan growth and expectations for the economy, we anticipate adding up to num-one basis point to the allowance for credit losses ratio throughout year-five to account for the change in provisioning to the life of loans.
as such, we will be increasing the common dividend by num-one% in year-five targeting a payout ratio of num-two% to num-three%.
