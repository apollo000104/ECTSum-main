as we noted on our qtr-one earnings call, april was down approximately num-one%, this was followed by slightly better volumes in may and then relatively strong finish in june, which was down, let's call it low double-digits.
segment margins were num-one%, down num-two basis points from qtr-one and our detrimental margins were at num-three%, num-four points better than our guidance of num-five%.
for qtr-two, revenues were down num-one%, with a num-two% decline organically and a num-three% currency impact.
and vehicle, we project revenues will decline between num-one% and num-two%.
for qtr-three and full year, we expect decremental margins of between num-one% and num-two% and for qtr-three, we expect our tax rate on adjusted earnings to be between num-three% and num-four%.
and vehicle, we project revenues will decline between num-one% and num-two%. our qtr-two revenues were $num-three billion, down num-four% organically.
qtr-two earnings on a per share basis were $num-one on a gaap basis and $num-two on adjusted basis, which excludes $num-three of charges related to acquisitions and divestitures and $num-four related to the multi-year restructuring program that we just announced.
our qtr-two revenues were $num-one billion, down num-two% organically.
we would expect to realize $num-one million of mature-year benefits from these actions once they are fully implemented and we think full year implementation is year-eight.
both very strong results and which gives us the ability to really reaffirm our free cash flow guidance of $num-one billion to $num-two billion and a midpoint of $num-three billion.
we're maintaining our free -- year-five free cash flow guidance, the range of $num-one billion to $num-two billion and i would note that this range does in fact, include now the impact related to the multi-year restructuring program that we announced, and that was not in our prior guidance.
qtr-two earnings on a per share basis were $num-one on a gaap basis and $num-two on adjusted basis, which excludes $num-three of charges related to acquisitions and divestitures and $num-four related to the multi-year restructuring program that we just announced.
