lastly, we are providing third quarter total revenue guidance of $num-one million to $num-two million.
this change reflects the impact of the qtr-two year-six performance as well as expectations for the remainder of the year.
on the personnel front, we recently issued an num-txt announcing the reorganization of my direct reports, rich lindahl, our chief financial officer; karen smith, our chief medical officer and katy strei, our chief human resources officer continued to report directly to me.
as you can see, we expect that the remainder of year-six will be busy for our product development teams, including clinical regulatory and quality as our pipeline continues to mature.
