throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of a pandemic which combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $num-one in the quarter, up approximately num-two% versus year-four.
our adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $num-one increased num-two% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control, and a favorable operational tax rate.
our organic sales decline was num-one% in the quarter.
given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of num-one% to num-two% for the full year year-six when compared to year-four.
finally, for year-six, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $num-one to $num-two for the full year.
