our plans call for total sales growth of num-one% to num-two% in year-six, and that includes num-three points from the softex acquisition and a num-four to num-three point benefit from currencies.
on the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of $num-one to $num-two.
looking more closely at our business segments, we saw excellent performance in personal care, with num-one% organic sales growth and strong share performance.
