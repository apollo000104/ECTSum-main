as you probably noted in our news release and you can see on slide-num, we are reaffirming our long-term earnings-per-share growth rate in the upper half of the num-one% to num-two% range.
we now project earnings per share toward the lower end of the $num-one to $num-two range and this includes the $num-three per share impact of the credits.
