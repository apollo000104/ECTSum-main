when we put this together, we expect our year-six adjusted earnings per share will increase between num-one% and num-two% compared to year-five.
this will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by num-one% to num-two%.
we shifted our financial forecast for prioritizing cash and liquidity given the uncertainties and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $num-one billion.
in addition, in our year-five sustainability report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our scope num-one and num-two greenhouse gas emissions by one-third by num-three and achieving carbon neutrality by num-four.
finally, on cash, a high priority for eastman, we expect year-six to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $num-one billion.
