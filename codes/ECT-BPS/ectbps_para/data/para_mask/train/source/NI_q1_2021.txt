in the first quarter, we delivered non-gaap diluted net operating earnings of $num-one per share.
looking at our first quarter year-six results in slide-num, we had non-gaap net operating earnings of about $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share compared to non-gaap net operating earnings of about $num-three million or $num-four per diluted share in the first quarter of year-five.
as you saw in our release, today we narrowed our year-six non-gaap diluted net operating earnings guidance to a $num-one to a $num-two per share, which represents the upper half of the previous range.
with last month's convertible issuance, nisource is well positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan driven by continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs as well as our electric generation transition strategy.
