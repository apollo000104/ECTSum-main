as a result, our guidance range of $num-one to $num-two in our third fiscal quarter of year-seven reflects the impact of these supply chain challenges, which we continue to see as temporary.
we reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $num-one per diluted share, which was a slight increase over the second quarter of last year.
second quarter earnings per share rose slightly year-over-year to $num-one, although it was slightly below the bottom of our guidance range.
