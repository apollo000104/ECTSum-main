our business delivered another strong performance in the third quarter of year-six coming ahead of our expectation to achieve a record high quarterly adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-one.
our resulting adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-one represents plus num-two% organic growth, and plus num-three% in dollar terms, a very good performance.
this translate into an adjusted diluted earnings per share range of $num-one to $num-two, including an estimated favorable currency impact of $num-three at prevailing rates.
in combustibles, further sequential share gains supported total pmi volume growth of num-one% in qtr-three and we continue to expect total cigarette and htu volume growth for the year.
turning back now to our quarterly results, qtr-three total shipment volumes increased by plus num-one%, and by plus num-two% year-to-date.
