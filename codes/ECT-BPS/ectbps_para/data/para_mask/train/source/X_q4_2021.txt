adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $num-one per share and was significantly impacted by a noncash year-end true-up to our tax valuation allowance.
so we will continue to buy back our own stock and are pleased to announce an incremental $num-one million authorization.
as mentioned earlier, i am pleased to say that our board has authorized a new and incremental repurchase program of $num-one million.
it puts us on a path for another strong year in year-seven.
