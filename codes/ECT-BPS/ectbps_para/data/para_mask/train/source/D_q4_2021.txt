finally, we expect first quarter year-seven operating earnings per share to be between $num-one and $num-two.
our fourth quarter year-six operating earnings, as shown on slide-num, were $num-one per share, which included a $num-two hurt from worse-than-normal weather in our utility service territories for the quarter.
we're initiating year-seven operating earnings per share guidance of $num-one to $num-two per share.
