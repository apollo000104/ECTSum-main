as javier mentioned, our fourth-quarter results were slightly above the midpoint of our revised guidance.
we have repurchased to date an additional num-one million shares in year-seven.
now looking ahead to year-seven, our adjusted oi guidance is a range of $num-one billion to $num-two billion, and our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $num-three to $num-four per share.
finally, we expect free cash flow of $num-one million to $num-two billion in year-seven. as javier said, the incremental mortality due to covid in the fourth quarter was approximately num-three, compared to approximately num-four in qtr-three.
