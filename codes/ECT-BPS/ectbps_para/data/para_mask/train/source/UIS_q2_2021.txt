we're seeing early stage traction with ecs services expansion, with revenue from these services up num-one% year-over-year.
total company pipeline was up num-one% sequentially, though down num-two% year-over-year.
however, as of the end of july, pipeline was up num-one% versus the end of the first quarter this year and num-two% versus the end of the second quarter last year.
the growth was driven in part by higher license revenue than anticipated based on higher volumes than projected in the quarter, additionally, ecs services revenue grew num-one% year-over-year.
as a result, we're reaffirming our full year guidance range of num-one% to num-two% year-over-year revenue growth.
adjusted ebitda margin increased num-one basis points year-over-year to num-two%, and non-gaap diluted earnings per share increased significantly to $num-three from a loss of $num-four in the prior year period.
in conjunction with the final actions to achieve this, we recognized a non-cash settlement charges of approximately $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share, which was the only reason that our net loss from continuing operations was $num-three million or $num-four per diluted share.
