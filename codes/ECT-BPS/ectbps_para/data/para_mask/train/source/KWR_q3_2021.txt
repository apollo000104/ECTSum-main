in total, they're adding num-one million in revenue and $num-two million in ebitda.
our non-gaap earnings per share of $num-one grew num-two% compared to the prior year as our solid adjusted ebitda coupled with over a million of interest savings due to lower borrowing rates and average borrowings were partially offset by a slightly higher tax expense.
our record net sales of $num-one million increased num-two% from the prior year, driven by num-three% organic volumes, num-four% from our pricing initiatives, num-five% percent from acquisitions and num-six% from foreign exchange.
