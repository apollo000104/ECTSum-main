for the first quarter, we are establishing adjusted deps guidance to be between $num-one and $num-two.
based on what we just outlined, when you roll everything together, we are establishing our year-six full-year adjusted deps guidance to be in the range of $num-one and $num-two.
so all-in, this resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-one, which was above our guidance range.
