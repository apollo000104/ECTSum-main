our adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $num-one increased num-two% from year-four, reflecting sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the wright medical acquisition and a somewhat higher quarterly effective tax rate.
this is reflected in our upward narrowing of organic sales guidance to num-one% to num-two% compared to year-four.
based on our performance in sales ramp in the second quarter as well as our capital orders pipeline, we expect year-six organic net sales growth to be in the range of num-one% to num-two%.
our bullish sales outlook, combined with ongoing execution on margins and continued progress on wright medical integration has resulted in a raised full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $num-one to $num-two a share.
based on our performance in the first six months and including consideration of our improved full year wright medical performance impact, controlled spend ramp to facilitate growth and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $num-one to $num-two.
if foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately num-one%.
consistent with the upper range of our previous guidance, net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $num-one in the full year, and this is included in our revised guidance range.
