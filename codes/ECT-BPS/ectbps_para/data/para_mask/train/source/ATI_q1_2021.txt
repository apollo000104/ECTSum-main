that said, we still reported a loss for the quarter of $num-one per share.
on an earnings per share basis, as i mentioned earlier, we lost $num-one per share versus our guidance range of a loss between $num-two and $num-three.
as a whole, ati lost $num-one per share in qtr-one, well ahead of our expected loss range heading into the quarter.
as i mentioned earlier, we're seeing continued modest demand recovery for our jet engine forgings and the first signs of recovery for our other jet engine materials.
we're encouraged by these trends and expect them to continue expanding across year-six, and as domestic travel rates increase.
