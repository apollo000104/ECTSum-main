so in sum, we expect net sales growth for the year will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, with growth largely driven by volume in the front half and more of a balance of volume and price/mix in the back half.
with respect to earnings, we expect adjusted ebitda, including joint ventures and net income to gradually normalize as the year progresses, but it will be pressured during the first half by a step-up in input and transportation cost inflation as well as some residual effects of the pandemic's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and distribution operations.
the sales volume increase largely reflected the strong recovery in demand in the u.s., especially at full-service restaurants as well as improvement in some of our key international markets.
and as tom mentioned, we continue to expect overall u.s. french fry demand will return to pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis around the end of calendar year-six, which is essentially the beginning of our fiscal third quarter.
as a result, we expect input cost inflation, especially for edible oils, packaging and transportation, to be a significant headwind for fiscal year-seven.
