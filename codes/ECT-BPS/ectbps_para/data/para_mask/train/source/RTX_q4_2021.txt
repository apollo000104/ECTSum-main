as you saw in december, our board of directors also authorized a $num-one billion share repurchase program, positioning us to continue returning significant capital to shareowners, including at least $num-two billion of repurchases that we expect to complete in year-seven.
and as greg mentioned, we expect to buyback at least $num-one billion of rtx shares over the year , subject to market conditions.
adjusted earnings per share of $num-one was ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by commercial aftermarket strength at both collins and pratt, as well as favorability in our effective tax rate.
on a gaap basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $num-one per share and included $num-two of acquisition accounting adjustments, and net significant and/or non-recurring items.
at pratt, the team introduced the gtf advantage engine, which reduces fuel consumption and ctxt-num emissions by a total of num-one% compared to the prior generation engines.
sales of $num-one billion were in line with our expectations and were up num-two% organically versus prior year on an adjusted basis.
by channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up num-one%, driven by a num-two% increase in parts and repair, a num-three% in provisioning, and a num-four% increase in modification and upgrades.
sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up num-one%.
and that strategy, of course, is to drive top-line growth, margin expansion, and robust free cash flows through year-ten and beyond while at the same time continuing to invest in our businesses and returning significant capital to shareowners.
at the rtx level, we expect full year year-seven sales of between $num-one billion and $num-two billion.
from an earnings perspective, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $num-one to $num-two, up num-three% to num-four% year over year, and we expect to generate free cash flow of about $num-five billion.
all of this brings us to our outlook range of $num-one to $num-two per share.
our continued focus on operational excellence and program execution, along with our industry leading technologies, positions us well to continue to capitalize on the commercial aerospace recovery and to grow our defense franchises.
