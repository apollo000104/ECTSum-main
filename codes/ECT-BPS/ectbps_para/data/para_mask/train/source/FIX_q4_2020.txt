we finished the year with strong fourth quarter earnings per share of $num-one, and for the full year, we earned $num-two.
specifically, net income for the fourth quarter of year-five was $num-one million or $num-two per share as compared to $num-three million or $num-four per share in year-four.
so fourth quarter revenue was $num-one million, a decrease of $num-two million compared to the same quarter last year.
our backlog level at the end of the fourth quarter of year-five was $num-one billion.
