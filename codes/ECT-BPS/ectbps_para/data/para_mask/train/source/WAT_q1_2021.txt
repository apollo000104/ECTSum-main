our non-gaap earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased num-one% to $num-two in comparison to the $num-three last year.
our non-gaap earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased num-one% to $num-two in comparison to the $num-three last year.
in the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $num-one million, an increase of approximately num-two% in constant currency. currency translation increased sales growth by approximately num-three%, resulting in sales growth of num-four% as reported.
second quarter non-gaap earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $num-one to $num-two as the significant prior year covid cost savings actions start to normalize.
rolling all this together, and on a non-gaap basis, full-year year-six earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $num-one to $num-two, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings-per-share growth of approximately num-three percentage points.
on a gaap basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $num-one compared to $num-two last year.
these dynamics support updated full-year year-six guidance for constant currency sales growth up num-one% to num-two%.
we expect constant currency sales growth to be num-one% to num-two%.
