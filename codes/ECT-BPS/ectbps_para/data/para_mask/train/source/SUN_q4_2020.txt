volumes of num-one billion gallons were relatively unchanged from the third quarter, but remain down about num-two% from levels seen a year ago.
in december, we provided guidance for year-six for adjusted ebitda of between $num-one million and $num-two million.
underpinning this guidance are the following: fuel volumes in a range of num-one billion to num-two billion gallons; annual fuel margin between $num-three per gallon and $num-four per gallon; total operating expenses of between $num-five million and $num-six million; maintenance capital of $num-seven million; and growth capital of at least $num-eight million.
