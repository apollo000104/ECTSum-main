ebitda was $num-one million, generating $num-two million in operating cash flow and $num-three in earnings per share.
as a result, lp generated $num-one billion in sales, $num-two million of ebitda, $num-three million of operating cash flow, and $num-four in adjusted earnings per share.

the waterfalls on slides nine and num-one show year-over-year revenue and ebitda comparisons for the siding and osb segments.
we have the last vestiges of the discontinued fiber sales this quarter with $num-one million less revenue, but only $num-two million less ebitda.
we now anticipate spending $num-one million in year-six for the houlton conversion an increase of $num-two million of prior guidance largely due to increased costs for steel and labor.
for siding solutions, the third quarter should see year-over-year revenue growth of around num-one%, which would be another quarterly record despite the much stronger comparative.
and if we assume num-one% year-over-year revenue growth for the second half of this year siding solutions revenue growth will hit num-two% for the year, which is double our long-term guidance.
we're therefore guiding to osb revenue being roughly num-one% sequentially lower than the second quarter.

and so with further caveats about certain changes in demand raw material price and availability or other unforeseeable events, we expect ebitda for the third quarter to be at least $num-one million, which will not be another quarterly record for lp but will be second only to the quarter we've just finished to report it.
spending for other growth capital, is expected to be $num-one million and we anticipate spending about $num-two million on sustaining maintenance for full-year total capital outlay of $num-three million.
