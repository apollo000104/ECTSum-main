we further lowered our year-end share count to num-one million shares after spending $num-two million in the quarter to buy back a little over num-three million shares, and with taxes as the only meaningful adjustment to net income, adjusted earnings per share was $num-four compared to u.s. gaap earnings per share of $num-five.

smartside revenue is trending seasonally higher than the fourth quarter, on pace for at least num-one% growth compared to the first quarter of year-five.
we grew smartside revenue by num-one% and $num-two million of revenue and ebitda from higher osb prices and generated $num-three million in operating cash flow.
halfway through this first quarter of year-six, osb prices are at least num-one% higher than the fourth quarter of year-five on similar volumes.
should these trends continue and absent covid outbreaks or sudden reversals in logistics, raw material availability or osb prices, we expect ebitda for the first quarter of year-six to be at least $num-one million.
