we beat the consensus estimate of $num-one, as we reported qtr-two adjusted earnings per share of $num-two cents of share.
and i'm confident that our disciplined approach to operating business will result in continued success, throughout the balance of the year.
while we solidly beat qtr-two, and are ahead of our original plan at the halfway point, we still expect the second half of year-six to be slightly favorable in comparison to the second half of fiscal year-five, given the various elements of recovery that we are anticipating.
