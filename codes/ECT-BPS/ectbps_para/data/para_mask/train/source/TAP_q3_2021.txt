as gavin mentioned, we are again reaffirming our key financial annual guidance for year-six.
consolidated financial volumes declined num-one%, primarily due to lower brand volumes, which were down num-two%, largely due to the economy segment, including the economy sku deprioritization program.
net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased num-one% in constant currency, driven by the strong pricing growth, coupled with positive brand and channel mix.
we continue to anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $num-one million, and net interest expense of $num-two million, plus or minus num-three%.
