total sales grew num-one%, including a num-two% favorable impact from currency.
our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $num-one compared to $num-two in the prior year, driven by our strong operating performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate.
at the bottom line, as shown on slide-num, first quarter year-six adjusted earnings per share were $num-one as compared to $num-two for the year-ago period.
this results in total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of num-one% to num-two% in constant currency, increase from num-three% to num-four% previously. our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions projected to be num-five% to num-six% constant currency growth compared to num-seven% to num-eight% previously.
in our flavor solutions segment, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in year-six.
our guidance range for the adjusted earnings per share in year-six is now $num-one to $num-two compared to $num-three to $num-four previously.
