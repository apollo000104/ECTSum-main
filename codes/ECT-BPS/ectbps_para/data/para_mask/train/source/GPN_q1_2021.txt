putting it all together, we now have increased our expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year to a range of $num-one to $num-two reflecting growth of num-three% to num-four% over year-five.
adjusted earnings per share were $num-one for the quarter, an increase of num-two% compared to the prior year period and was especially impressive in light of the difficult year-on-year comparison due to covid.
