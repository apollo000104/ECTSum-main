in recognition of our strong financial position and confidence in our business, i'm pleased to share that our board of directors declared a num-one% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $num-two per share, marking num-three consecutive years of dividend increases, with a compound annual growth rate of num-four% over that period.
our first quarter results include $num-one million of pre-tax cat losses, an all-time high for our first quarter cats and an increase of $num-two million compared to last year's first quarter.
the increase in core income resulted primarily from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlying underwriting results, and increased net investment income, largely offset by a much higher level of catastrophe losses.
