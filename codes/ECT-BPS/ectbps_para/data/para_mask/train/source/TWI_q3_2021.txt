sales grew at a very nice clip at num-one% this quarter.
we are now expecting to see our full year adjusted ebitda coming in above $num-one million, which is our highest annual total since num-two.
there are continuing positive signs in our end markets, which puts titan in a good position, as i stated earlier, to post adjusted year-six adjusted ebitda of over $num-one million.
on a trailing num-txtonth basis, our adjusted ebitda stands at $num-one million as of this quarter, and we expect qtr-four performance to be strong, improving that run rate to over $num-two million for fiscal year-six.
