our quarterly earnings per diluted share of $num-one were also a record and substantially exceeded our outlook.
as a result of all these factors, we generated record quarterly earnings per share of $num-one in the first quarter of year-six compared to $num-two in the first quarter of year-five.
based on these expectations, we currently anticipate non-gaap earnings per diluted share in the range of $num-one and to $num-two for the second quarter of year-six.
on a non-gaap basis, our first quarter earnings of $num-one per share significantly exceeded our outlook and were up num-two% from $num-three in the fourth quarter of year-five and up num-four% from $num-five in the first quarter of year-five.
since current metal prices are substantially higher than the average selling price in the first quarter of year-six, we estimate our average selling price per ton sold for the second quarter of year-six will be up num-one% to num-two%.
given the strong demand and pricing fundamentals, we anticipate continued strength in our gross profit margin in the second quarter of year-six.
we entered the second quarter of year-six with strong demand and pricing momentum that creates an environment for us to optimize our model and deliver strong results.
