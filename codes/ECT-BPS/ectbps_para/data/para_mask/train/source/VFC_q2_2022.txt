over the past five years, we have strategically evolved and simplified our portfolio from num-one brands to num-two brands, each with significant txt-numc and international opportunity, squarely focused on large, growing addressable markets.
we are holding our revenue guidance to be about $num-one billion despite a weaker china outlook in the near term and a lower than expected back-to-school performance at vans in the u.s. and ongoing supply chain challenges; all of this, highlighting the broad-based strength across our brands and geographies.
as a result, i'm proud of our ability to hold on to our fiscal year-seven earnings outlook of about $num-one despite a more challenging than anticipated operating environment, including an incremental headwind of about $num-two from expedited freight.
finally, as discussed, we are reaffirming our full year earnings outlook of around $num-one despite about $num-two of incremental costs directly attributed to the supply chain disruption; a strong testament of portfolio resiliency and the optionality of our model.
total vf revenue increased num-one% to $num-two billion despite a significant amount of orders shifted from qtr-two into qtr-three, implying continued sequential underlying improvement for the portfolio.
