when you look at the strip, last year -- i mean, of the strip over the next several years as it continues to move up and look at our model of growing oil production num-one% per year over the next several years, our reinvestment rate will actually be below, we say num-two to num-three% here.
it'll actually be below num-one%.
as we have already stated, approximately -- this actually represents num-one% of our current enterprise value, that num-two -- total enterprise value, including market cap plus debt.
and the primary driver is really just our low -- our margins in the high num-txt, our low-cost basis in addition to the fact that we're paying out num-one% of our cash flow versus devon's num-two%.
this is greater than a num-one% improvement when compared to our program average.
total capex is now projected at $num-one billion to $num-two billion on cash flow of about $num-three billion based on strip prices, which is leading to what scott talked about, $num-four billion of free cash flow for the year.
you can see our -- for a full year, that we plan to average num-one to num-two rigs and deliver num-three to num-four pops.
