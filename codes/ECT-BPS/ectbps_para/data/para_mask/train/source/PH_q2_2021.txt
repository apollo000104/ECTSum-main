we generated $num-one this quarter and that compares to $num-two last year.
if you move to slide-num, this is just a walk from the $num-one to the $num-two for the quarter and despite organic sales declining num-three% and total sales declining num-four%, adjusted segment operating income increased by $num-five million or $num-six, that equated to $num-seven per share,so very strong operating beat for the quarter.
and then if you look at the remaining items, other expense was just $num-one, slightly higher, we had a higher effective tax rate that impacted us by $num-two and finally slightly higher diluted shares resulted in a $num-three impact, that's how we get to the $num-four.
full-year effective tax rate, no change, we still expect that to be num-one%, and for the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as reported basis is now $num-two to $num-three or $num-four at the midpoint and on an adjusted per share basis, the guidance range is now $num-five to $num-six or $num-seven, at the midpoint.
so, all-in, we came in flat and that's the first time in seven quarters, i believe that the numbers have been not negative.
if you go to slide-num, we're going to talk about cash flow the cash flow quarter paid down $num-one million of debt in a quarter.
so i'm not going to talk about on this really today, but their historical success factors that will continue on into the future.
