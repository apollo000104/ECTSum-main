total revenue was $num-one billion, up num-two% year-over-year or num-three% on a constant currency basis.
we continue to expect total revenue between $num-one billion and $num-two billion, representing year-over-year constant currency growth of num-three% to num-four%.
given the outlook i just provided, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $num-one to $num-two, up from the prior $num-three to $num-four range due to the favorable impact of the nonrecurring tax benefit as well as the balance sheet remeasurement gains during the quarter.
