on a gaap earnings per share basis, we reported $num-one for the third quarter of year-six compared to $num-two for the third quarter of year-five.
so this raises our guidance for year-seven utility earnings per share to $num-one to $num-two.
and as dave said, we are also raising our utility earnings per share guidance for year-seven to $num-one to $num-two, which is an num-three% increase from our new year-six estimates.
our year-six through year-nine annual utility earnings per share growth rates of num-one% are top decile among our peers, and we also expect to achieve at the mid- to high end of our num-two% to num-one% utility earnings per share guidance range each year from year-ten to num-three.
more importantly, we are still targeting an num-one% annual growth rate for year-seven to year-nine.
and as dave said, we are also raising our utility earnings per share guidance for year-seven to $num-one to $num-two, which is an num-three% increase from our new year-six estimates.
looking beyond that, we are focused on delivering num-one% annual utility earnings per share growth through year-nine and at the mid- to high end of our num-two% to num-one% annual utility earnings per share range over the remainder of our num-txtear plan, strong growth each year and every year, no cagrs for earnings.
for the third time this year, we are increasing our year-six utility earnings per share guidance this time to $num-one to $num-two for the full year.
for the first nine months, we've achieved nearly num-one% of our full year year-six utility earnings per share guidance, which we are now raising to $num-two to $num-three.
