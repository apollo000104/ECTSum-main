gic's num-one% equity interest will be a cash contribution totaling approximately $num-two million, and our num-three% controlling interest will come from a combination of common and preferred op units.
the utilization of common and preferred op units for our num-one% equity interest will preserve nearly all of our liquidity of $num-two million, leaving us ample runway to pursue additional growth opportunities.
