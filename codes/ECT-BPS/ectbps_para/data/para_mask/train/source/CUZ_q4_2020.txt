year-six is a transition year for cousins from an earnings perspective.
on the operations front, the teams delivered $num-one per share in ffo with second generation cash rents of num-two%.
ffo was $num-one per share for the quarter and $num-two per share for all of year-five.
we collected num-one% of rent from all customers and num-two% of rent from office customers in the fourth quarter.
looking forward, we're providing initial year-six ffo guidance of between $num-one and $num-two per share.
please also note that our earnings guidance assumes physical occupancy will remain significantly below normalized levels until the second half of year-six.
