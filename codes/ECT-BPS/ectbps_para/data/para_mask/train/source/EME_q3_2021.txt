consolidated revenues of $num-one billion are up $num-two million or num-three% over quarter num-four, year-five and represent a new all-time quarterly revenue record for emcor.
against that backdrop in comparison for the third quarter of year-six, we were able to post $num-one and earnings per diluted share, versus $num-two of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the year ago period.
diluted earnings per common share of $num-one represents a new quarterly record for the company and compares to $num-two per diluted share in last year's third quarter.

as previously communicated, my expectation for full year year-six was operating cash flow in excess of $num-one million.
with our upward revision in year-six revenue expectations, i am still targeting the same level of operating cash flow performance, but it is possible that we may not eclipse the $num-one million target should our working capital investment be greater than expected during the fourth quarter.
our board of directors just authorized a new and our largest share repurchase authorization of an additional $num-one million.
