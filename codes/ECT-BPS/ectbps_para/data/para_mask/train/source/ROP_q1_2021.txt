based on strong qtr-one performance and our increased confidence for the balance of the year, we're raising our full-year adjusted deps to be in the range of $num-one and $num-two per share and organic growth to be in the num-three% to num-four% range.
for the second quarter, we're establishing adjusted deps guidance to be between $num-one and $num-two and expect second quarter organic revenue growth to be in line with the full-year organic growth rate.
adjusted deps was $num-one, num-two% above prior year.
total revenue increased num-one% to $num-two billion, which was an all-time record for any roper quarter.
