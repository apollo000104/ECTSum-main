net income attributable to common stock was $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-gaap measure, was $num-three.
net income attributable to common stock was $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-gaap measure, was $num-three.
these segment operating ranges support our expectation for year-six annual revenues of $num-one billion to $num-two billion, and adjusted ebitda, a non-gaap measure, of between $num-three billion and $num-four billion.
with these operating results, we estimate our range of gaap diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $num-one and $num-two, and anticipate non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $num-three and $num-four.
