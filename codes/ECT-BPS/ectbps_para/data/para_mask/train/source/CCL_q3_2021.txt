i'll start today with a review of our guest cruise operations along with our third quarter monthly average cash burn rate.
our booking volumes for the all future cruises during the third quarter year-six were higher than booking volumes during the first quarter.
our cumulative advanced book position for the second half of year-seven is ahead of a very strong year-four and is at a new historical high.
as we previously guided, the ships in service during the third quarter were, in fact, cash flow positive.
revenue per passenger cruise day for the third quarter year-six increased compared to a strong year-four despite the current constraints on itinerary offerings which did not include many of the higher-yielding destination-rich itineraries offered in year-four.
for the third quarter year-six, our cash burn rate was $num-one million per month, which was better than our previous guidance and was in line with the $num-two million per month for the first half of year-six.
we have also opened bookings earlier for cruises in year-eight, and we're achieving those early bookings with strong demand and good prices.
with the timing of certain capital expenditures now shifting to the fourth quarter, the company expects its monthly average cash burn rate for the fourth quarter to be higher than the monthly average rate for the first nine months of the year.

we do anticipate that most of these costs and expenses will end with year-seven and will not reoccur in fiscal year-eight.
we're evaluating the remaining shifts through next spring, with a continued focus on maximizing future cash flow while delivering a great guest experience in a way that serves the best interest of public health.
