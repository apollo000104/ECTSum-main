e-commerce, which was num-one% of our revenue in year-four grew by num-two% in the first quarter and the positive momentum has continued into the second quarter as we reap the benefits of the long-term investments we have made in digital and e-commerce, such as upgrades and redesigns of websites, enhanced search engine optimization and new enterprise order management systems.
our stores and restaurants, which make up num-one% of our overall sales in year-four just began to reopen in early may, and we expect to have almost all of our locations open by the end of june.
we have ample liquidity to meet our ongoing cash requirements, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet entering the pandemic, as well as the recent actions we have taken to mitigate the covid impact.
we are pleased with our efforts and inventory at quarter end increased only num-one% despite the significant sales decline.
but we don't expect revenue from stores to reach prior year levels at anytime during year-five.
