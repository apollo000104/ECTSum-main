the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of num-one% to num-two%, up from num-three% to num-one%.
net loss was $num-one million or $num-two per share versus net income of $num-three million or $num-four per diluted share.
in total, we anticipate cost savings approximately $num-one million annually.
we also have more than num-one products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts.
the plan is expected to be completed in approximately num-one months and generate annual cost savings of approximately $num-two million.
gross profit was $num-one million or num-two% of net sales compared with $num-three million or num-four% of net sales for the prior year first quarter.
for fiscal year-seven, we now expect net sales in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million, down from $num-two million to $num-three million.
we have revised down our fiscal year-seven guidance to reflect the increasingly competitive environment for a base oral generics portfolio.
so with that, let's turn to the restructuring and cost reduction plan we announced earlier today.
again, our plan retains our core strategies while further optimizing our operations, improving efficiencies and reducing costs.
the plan will be implemented in phases, and we expect we will be completed in about num-one months.
the plan is expected to be completed in approximately num-one months and generate annual cost savings of approximately $num-two million.
and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $num-one million to $num-two million, down from $num-three million to $num-four million.
this includes reducing headcount and eliminating development formerly dedicated to the carmel site and discontinuing future development programs targeting liquid generic medications as we no longer see adequately scaled returns in that sector.
ultimately, the plan is expected to result in a workforce reduction of approximately num-one% from current levels.
in total, we anticipate cost savings approximately $num-one million annually.
we also have more than num-one products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts.
the plan is expected to be completed in approximately num-one months and generate annual cost savings of approximately $num-two million.
gross profit was $num-one million or num-two% of net sales compared with $num-three million or num-four% of net sales for the prior year first quarter.
