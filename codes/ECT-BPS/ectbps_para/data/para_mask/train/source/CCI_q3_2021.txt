and we increased our annualized common stock dividend by approximately num-one% to $num-two per share, marking the second consecutive year of dividend growth that meaningfully exceeds our long-term target.
our significant out-performance in year-six combined with our forecast for year-seven enabled us to raise our dividend num-one%, well above our stated goal for the second year in a row.
since we established our common stock dividend in num-one, we have grown dividends per share at a compounded annual growth rate of num-two% with growth ranging from num-three% to num-four% in each year.
we expect to generate num-one% growth in affo per share in year-seven at the high end of our long-term growth target and supported by an expected num-two% increase in tower core leasing activity and we increased our common stock dividend by num-three% for the second consecutive year.
we expect to be at the high end of our growth target in year-seven with num-one% affo per share growth and we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by num-two% for the second consecutive year, meaningfully above our long-term target growth rate while maintaining a consistent payout ratio.
our third quarter results were highlighted by num-one% growth in site rental revenues, num-two% growth in adjusted ebitda and num-three% growth in affo per share when compared to the same period last year.
we are maintaining our year-six outlook with site rental revenues, adjusted ebitda and affo growing num-one%, num-two% and num-three% respectively.
in conclusion, we are excited about the outsized growth we are generating as a result of the initial num-txt build out by our customers, which is translating into back-to-back years of num-one% growth in our quarterly common stock dividend.
