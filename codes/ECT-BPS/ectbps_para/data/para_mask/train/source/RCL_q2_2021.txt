as a result, we anticipate having about num-one% of our fleet in service at the end of the third quarter and approximately num-two% of the fleet back in operation by the end of the year.
now as it pertains to our debt maturities, our scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of this year and year-seven are $num-one million and $num-two billion.
overall, the booking activity for year-six sailings is consistent with our expected capacity and occupancy ramp-up at prices that are higher than year-four.
it is still a bit early in the booking window to provide too much color for next year, but i will share that our booked load factors continue to be well within historical ranges at prices that are up nicely versus year-four, including the dilutive impact of fccs.
that being said, the first quarter is booked within historical ranges.
