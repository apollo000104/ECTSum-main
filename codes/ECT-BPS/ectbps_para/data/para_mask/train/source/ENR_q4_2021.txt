we also expect reported revenue will be negatively impacted by foreign currency headwinds of $num-one million to $num-two million at current rates.
over the last five years the auto care category has shown consistent growth, a trend that continued in the latest num-one weeks with category value up num-two% versus year ago and num-three% versus year-four.
these inflationary cost pressures, combined with the anticipated volume declines in battery in the first half of the year, are expected to result in adjusted earnings per share in the range of $num-one to $num-two and adjusted ebitda in the range of $num-three million to $num-four million.
in fiscal year-seven organic sales will be roughly flat with auto care growth and pricing actions across our businesses, offset by volume declines in battery as we comp prior year elevated demand in the first half of the year.
while the categories are showing resilience, the macro environment in which we are operating is volatile, which leads me to the next important topic around operating costs.
now turning to our fiscal year-seven outlook.
