as i mentioned earlier, adjusted earnings per share of $num-one was better-than-expected, mainly as a result of better organic sales, productivity, and a slightly lower tax rate.
our adjusted earnings per share guidance range on the new basis is $num-one to $num-two.
arr is expected to grow double digits in fiscal year-six, after showing over num-one% growth in fiscal num-two. in qtr-four, total reported sales declined by num-three% versus the prior year.
we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of num-one% to num-two% and about num-three% at the mid-point of our range.
during the fourth quarter, we paid off the $num-one million term loan that we executed earlier in the year, and our net debt to ebitda ratio at [date] was num-two.
