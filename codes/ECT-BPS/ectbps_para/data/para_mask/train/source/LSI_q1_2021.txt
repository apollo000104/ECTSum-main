the net effect of the same-store revenue and expense performance was an increase in net operating income of num-one% for the quarter. first quarter same-store revenue accelerated significantly again to num-two% year-over-year, up num-three basis points from the num-four% growth produced in the fourth quarter.
based on these assumptions changes, we anticipate adjusted ffo per share for the year-six year to be between $num-one and $num-two.
