as kevin noted, fourth quarter sales were $num-one billion, an increase of num-two% from the same quarter in fiscal year-five and a num-three% increase from the same quarter in fiscal year-four.
adjusted earnings per share increased $num-one to $num-two for the fourth quarter.
given the interest in the recovery curve from covid, today we are disclosing that our july fiscal year-seven sales were also quite strong.
and based on the early strength of the recovery that kevin mentioned during his remarks, as impacted by inflation and our continued progress against managing through the snap-back and investing for growth, we are increasing our guidance on adjusted earnings per share by $num-one for fiscal year year-seven by moving the range up to $num-two to $num-three.
