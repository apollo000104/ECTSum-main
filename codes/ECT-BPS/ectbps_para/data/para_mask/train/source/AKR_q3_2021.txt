our third quarter earnings of $num-one a share exceeded our expectations, landing us in the upper end of the $num-two to $num-one range that we had guided toward on our most recent call.
in terms of near-term ffo expectations, we continue to anticipate $num-one to $num-two of quarterly ffo, excluding any potential albertson sales for the next few quarters.
and given our expectation of near-term ffo of $num-one to $num-two, this gets us in the [indecipherable] [time] num-three, num-four in range for year-six, and that's without any albertson shares, which is more than num-five% above the midpoint of our initial range as well as num-six% to num-seven% above the high end of our range.
