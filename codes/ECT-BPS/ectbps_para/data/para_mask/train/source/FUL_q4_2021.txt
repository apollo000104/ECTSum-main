last evening, h.b. fuller reported strong fourth quarter results, including num-one% year-over-year revenue growth, a $num-two million of ebitda at the high end of our guidance and $num-three of adjusted eps.
adjusted earnings per share were $num-one, up versus the fourth quarter of year-five, despite a higher tax rate in qtr-four year-six, which drove a negative year-on-year impact of about $num-two per share.
these assumptions would result in full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $num-one to $num-two.
for the quarter, revenue was up num-one% versus the same period last year.
based on what we know today, we anticipate full year double-digit organic revenue growth in the range of num-one% to num-two%, and we estimate that currency will have a negative impact on revenue of about num-three% to num-four%.
we expect adjusted ebitda to be between $num-one million and $num-two million, representing a num-three% to num-four% year-on-year increase, as pricing leverage and operational efficiencies more than offset higher raw material costs.
full year year-six organic revenue increased by num-one%, led by num-two% volume growth and strong contributions from pricing.
we expect adjusted ebitda to be between $num-one million and $num-two million, representing a num-three% to num-four% year-on-year increase, as pricing leverage and operational efficiencies more than offset higher raw material costs.
we have over $num-one million in pricing actions taking effect in qtr-one, and we will take whatever pricing actions are necessary in year-seven to fully offset raw material cost increases and enable us to restore margins.
