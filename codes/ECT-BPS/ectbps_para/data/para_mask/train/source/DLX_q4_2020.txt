all of this means, we expect to achieve full-year year-six revenue growth of num-one% to num-two% with full year year-six adjusted ebitda margin of num-three% to num-four%.
our total revenue in the quarter was $num-one million, a decline of num-two% as compared to the same period last year; however, an increase of num-three% from the third quarter.
we are poised for recovery to begin in the second quarter enabling us to exit the year a sales-driven mid-single-digit revenue growth company.
as barry mentioned, dlx delivered in year-five; we delivered ebitda margin in line with our plan and guidance.
