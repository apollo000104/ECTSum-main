earlier today, we reported fourth-quarter revenue of $num-one billion, net earnings of $num-two billion, and earnings per diluted share of $num-three.
for the full year, revenue of $num-one billion is up $num-two million, a num-three% increase after a num-four% growth in year-four despite a revenue decline at els, driven by covid shutdowns in spain earlier in year-five. in particular, this reduces our corporate operating earnings, which we expect to be a negative $num-five million in year-six, and increases our other income, which is below the line, which we expect to be approximately $num-six million in year-six.
