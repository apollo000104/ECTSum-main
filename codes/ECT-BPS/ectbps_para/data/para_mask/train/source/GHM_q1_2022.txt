revenue in the quarter was $num-one million, $num-two million was organic and $num-three million was due to the acquisition of barber-nichols that closed [date].
as i discuss that first quarter, i would like you to keep in mind that our full year guidance is unchanged.
defense revenue was num-one% of total revenue in the quarter.
and now, num-one years later, we won back the installation and replaced the original supplier with our own vacuum systems.
