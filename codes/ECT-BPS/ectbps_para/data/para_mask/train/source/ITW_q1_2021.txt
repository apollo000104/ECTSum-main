gaap earnings per share of $num-one was up num-two% and an all-time earnings per share record for continuing operations.
for the full year, we now expect organic growth of num-one% to num-two%, operating margin in the range of num-three% to num-four%, and earnings per share of $num-five to $num-six per share, which at the $num-seven midpoint represents num-eight% earnings growth versus last year.
finally, we are raising our gaap earnings per share guidance by $num-one and or num-two% to a new range of $num-three to $num-four.
a few final housekeeping items to wrap it up, with no changes to: one, the forecast for free cash flow; two, our plan to repurchase approximately $num-one billion of our own shares; and three, our expected tax rate of num-two% to num-three%.
