while the delta between rates is not significant, i'll point out that current and prior year rates were well below what we would typically expect.
finally, we plan to repurchase at least num-one% of outstanding shares in fiscal year-six, which would offset any dilution from stock-based compensation.
should conditions improve, it is not unreasonable to assume this goal above the num-one% in fiscal year-six.
additionally, we expect sales during the first half of year-six will be down versus the prior year due to the timing of when the pandemic began.
sales are expected to vary widely by geography and market and sales of our replacement parts and products for new markets should continue to outperform the company average.
