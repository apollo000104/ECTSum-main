third quarter operating ffo per share of $num-one was up $num-two over last quarter primarily due to about $num-three of higher noi from acquisitions, $num-four from lower rent not probable of collection and about $num-four from higher lease termination fees, partially offset by lower straight-line rent.
our third quarter operating ffo per share of $num-one benefited from $num-two related to nonrecurring items, including a prior period favorable bad debt adjustment and a one-time lease termination fee.
we initiated a new range for operating ffo of $num-one to $num-two per share, which is up $num-three or num-four% over prior guidance.
