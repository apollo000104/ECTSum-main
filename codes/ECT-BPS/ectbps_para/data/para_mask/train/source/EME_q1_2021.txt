we earned $num-one per diluted share versus $num-two in the year-ago period on revenues of $num-three billion with operating income margins of num-four%.
diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter is $num-one as compared to $num-two per diluted share for the prior year period.
and we're going to take the top end of the range up about a $num-one or $num-two per diluted share. and so with that, we're going to raise the low end of our guidance range to $num-three".
and we expected to do that on $num-one billion to $num-two billion in revenue.
