so now i'll provide some thoughts on why i believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in year-six and beyond.
we expect net sales to be up num-one% to num-two%.
we expect organic sales growth to be within our num-one% to num-two% long-term target range.
we expect our gross profit margin to be up year over year in year-six despite difficult comparisons given our performance in year-five, increases in raw materials, and the continuing uncertainty associated with covid.
