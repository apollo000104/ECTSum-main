we also set two additional quarterly company records: we generated the highest quarterly home closing gross margin of num-one% in company history as a result of pricing power, more than offsetting the elevated lumber and other commodity costs; and our quarterly diluted earnings per share of $num-two was the highest in our company's history.

higher closing volume, pricing power, expanded gross margin and the improved overhead leverage that we achieved this quarter all led to the num-one% year-over-year increase in third quarter diluted earnings per share of $num-two.
with more than num-one units in backlog and another almost num-two specs in the ground today, we are projecting num-three to num-four home closings for the full year of year-six, which we anticipate will generate $num-five billion to $num-six billion in home closing revenue.
with an increase to the projected effective tax rate to num-one%, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $num-two to $num-three for year-six, a year-over-year increase of over num-four%.
our third quarter closings totaled num-one homes. the num-two% year-over-year home closing revenue growth to $num-three billion in the third quarter of year-six was the result of the num-four% increase in home closings and num-five% higher closing asp despite the mix shift to more entry-level products.
