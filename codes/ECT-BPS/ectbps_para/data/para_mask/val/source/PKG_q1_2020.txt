excluding special items, first quarter year-five net income was $num-one million or $num-two per share compared to the first quarter of year-four net income of $num-three million or $num-four per share.
yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $num-one million or $num-two per share.
first quarter net sales were $num-one billion in both year-five and year-four.
we know that we experienced a demand surge in our packaging business in the first quarter, and the second quarter has also begun quite strong as well.
however, due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic and the timing of the global recovery and economic normalization, we're not able to properly quantify our guidance for the second quarter.
