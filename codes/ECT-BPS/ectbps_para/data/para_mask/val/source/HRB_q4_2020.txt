i'm pleased to announce that despite the financial impact of covid and the extended tax season, our board of directors has declared a $num-one per share dividend payable [date].
as we announced in late march, we believe we have sufficient funds to support the business at the start of tax season year-six.
we recorded a $num-one million non-cash goodwill impairment at wave due to the pandemic and its impact on small businesses.
