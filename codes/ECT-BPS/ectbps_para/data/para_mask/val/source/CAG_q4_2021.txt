as i noted earlier, our adjusted earnings per share of $num-one was in line with our expectations despite higher-than-expected inflation.
the impact of the volume decline was partially offset by a num-one% benefit from favorable mix and the initial pricing actions we took in response to the elevated inflationary environment, which i will describe in further detail shortly.
organic net sales growth is expected to be roughly flat to fiscal year-six.
adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately num-one%, and adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $num-two.
for fiscal year-seven, we now expect organic net sales growth approximately flat to fiscal year-six, adjusted operating margin of approximately num-one%, and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $num-two.
second, the largest driver of the change is the significant $num-one per share increase in inflation since qtr-three that i just discussed.
