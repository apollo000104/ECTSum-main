merchandise inventories were $num-one billion at the end of the year, an increase of num-two% overall and num-three% on a per-store basis.

despite approximately num-one lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country, same-store sales for the month of february increased num-two%, reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of num-three% on a two-year stack basis.
