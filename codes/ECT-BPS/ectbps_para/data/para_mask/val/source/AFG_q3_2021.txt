as you'll see on slide-num, afg reported core net operating earnings of $num-one per share, an impressive num-two% increase year-over-year.
turning to slide-num, you'll see the third quarter year-six net earnings per share of $num-one included non-core after-tax realized losses on securities of $num-two per share, most of which pertain to fair value adjustments on securities that we continue to hold at the end of the quarter.
based on results for the first nine months of the year, we now expect afg's core net operating earnings in year-six to be in the range of $num-one to $num-two, up significantly from our previous range of $num-three to $num-four per share.
