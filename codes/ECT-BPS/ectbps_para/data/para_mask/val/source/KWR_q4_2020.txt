excluding similar cost adjustments of qtr-four, we estimate our gross margins in year-five and year-four would have been num-one% and num-two% respectively.
and i look forward to continuing to be involved in the company's bright future as chairman of the board following my retirement.
our non-gaap earnings per share of $num-one for qtr-four is up num-two% from $num-three in qtr-four of year-four, due primarily to the improved operating income i discussed earlier.
