as a result, our adjusted earnings per share were $num-one and $num-two for full year year-five and the fourth quarter respectively.
since the onset of the pandemic in mid-march, our performance has achieved sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement with our fourth quarter domestic systemwide revpar declining num-one% from the same quarter of year-four.
our fourth quarter year-five domestic systemwide revpar surpassed the industry by nearly num-one percentage points, declining num-two% from the same period of the prior year and improved by num-three basis points from the third quarter.
the ultimate and precise impact of the pandemic on our business for year-six and beyond remains largely unknown as is the exact trajectory of our industry's recovery.
turning to year-six, we expect our momentum to continue into the first quarter, allowing choice hotels to further outperform the industry in the current environment.
