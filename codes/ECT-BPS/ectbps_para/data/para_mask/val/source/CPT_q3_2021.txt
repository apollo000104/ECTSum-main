last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of year-six of $num-one million or $num-two per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $num-three per share, which resulted primarily from approximately $num-four in higher same-store noi, resulting from $num-five of higher revenue driven by higher rental rates, higher occupancy and lower bad debt, partially offset by $num-four of higher operating expenses entirely driven by higher-than-anticipated amounts of self-insured expenses.
we expect ffo per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $num-one to $num-two.
