for the first quarter, we anticipate revenue in the range of $num-one-num-two million, which will represent another record quarter for fabrinet.
in addition to record revenue, we also delivered record non-gaap operating margins of num-one%, resulting in an all-time high non-gaap earnings per share of $num-two in the fourth quarter.
we also executed very well, hit our highest gross margin in four years, and record operating margins to produce non-gaap earnings of $num-one per share, which also exceeded our guidance.
on a gaap basis, net income was also a record at $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share.
from a profitability perspective, we anticipate non-gaap net income to be in the range of $num-one to $num-two per diluted share.
