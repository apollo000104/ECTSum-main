on to our updated guidance for the full-year year-six.
for the quarter ended [date], year-six, we generated approximately $num-one billion in revenue, up $num-two million or num-three%.
we are, therefore, raising our revenue guidance from a prior range of $num-one billion and $num-two billion to now between $num-three billion and $num-four billion.
and on adjusted ebitda, we're raising the range from $num-one million to $num-two million to between $num-three million and $num-four million.
