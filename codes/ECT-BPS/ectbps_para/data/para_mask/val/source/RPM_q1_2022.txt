turning to slide-num, on a consolidated basis, our sales increased to a record $num-one billion up num-two% over a strong fiscal year-six first quarter, which grew num-three%.
i'll now move on to slide-num, as we look ahead to our fiscal year-seven second quarter we anticipate that raw material, trade, and wage inflation will persist.
we expect our fiscal year-seven second-quarter consolidated sales to increase in the mid-single digits.
however, in a similar manner to the first quarter, we expect the consumer segment's second-quarter sales to be above its pre-pandemic level, which is a fair comparison.
