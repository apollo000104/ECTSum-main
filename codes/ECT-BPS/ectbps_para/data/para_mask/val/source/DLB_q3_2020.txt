net income on a non-gaap basis in the third quarter was $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share, compared to $num-three million, or $num-four per diluted share in qtr-three of last year.
net income on a non-gaap basis in the third quarter was $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share, compared to $num-three million, or $num-four per diluted share in qtr-three of last year.
net income on a gaap basis in the third quarter was $num-one million, or $num-two per diluted share, compared to $num-three million or $num-four per diluted share in last year's qtr-three.
so to summarize, our scenario for total revenue in qtr-four is a range of $num-one million to $num-two million.
based on a combination of the factors i just reviewed, we estimate the qtr-four diluted earnings per share on the gaap basis could range from five -- from about $num-one to about $num-two; and then on a non-gaap basis, we estimate, it would range from about $num-three to $num-four.
based on a combination of the factors i just reviewed, we estimate the qtr-four diluted earnings per share on the gaap basis could range from five -- from about $num-one to about $num-two; and then on a non-gaap basis, we estimate, it would range from about $num-three to $num-four.
and as for the full-year, if you do the math, that would mean that our fy year-five revenue for the full-year could range from $num-one million to $num-two million; gaap diluted earnings per share could range from $num-three to $num-four; and non-gaap diluted earnings per share could range from $num-five to $num-six.
