based on these expectations, we currently anticipate non-gaap earnings per diluted share in the range of $num-one to $num-two for the fourth quarter of year-five.
non-gaap net income attributable to reliance for the third quarter of year-five was $num-one million, resulting non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $num-two, down from $num-three in the third quarter of year-four and mainly due to lower pricing, demand levels; and up from $num-four in the second quarter of year-five due to our strong gross profit margin and recovering demand.
on a gaap basis, our earnings per diluted share were $num-one in the third quarter year-five.
our net sales of $num-one billion for the third quarter of year-five decreased num-two% from the third quarter of year-four, with our tons sold down num-three% and our average selling price down num-four%.
while macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the covid pandemic continues, based on current expectations and market conditions, we anticipate that overall demand will continue to slowly improve in the fourth quarter of year-five.
as a result, we estimate our tons sold will be down num-one% to num-two% in the fourth quarter of year-five compared to the third quarter of year-five.
our tons sold exceeded our expectations of flat to up num-one% from the prior quarter as demand in many of our end markets improved, with the most notable strength in nonresidential construction.
as a result, we expect our average selling price in the fourth quarter of year-five will be flat to up num-one% compared to the third quarter of year-five.
as a result, we believe we are well positioned to maintain our presence as a dominant player in the energy spaces and support any further recovery in that market.
as such, we remain cautiously optimistic that demand for nonresidential construction activity will continue to improve through the end of the year based on healthy backlogs and positive customer sentiment.
