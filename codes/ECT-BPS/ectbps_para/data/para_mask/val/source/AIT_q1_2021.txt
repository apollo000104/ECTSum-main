however, it's important to note that visibility remains limited ahead of the seasonally slower winter months as customers continue to manage through an uncertain macro and pandemic outlook near term.
that said, to provide some directional views near term based on month-to-day trends in october and assuming normal sequential patterns in daily sales rates for the balance of the quarter, we would expect fiscal second quarter year-six sales to decline num-one% to num-two% organically on a year-over-year basis.
if customers reduce underlying production activity, or extend these plant shutdowns, this could drive organic declines that are greater than the num-one% to num-two% assumption.
on the other hand, if we see ongoing improvement in underlying industrial activity and further traction with our internal growth initiatives, organic declines could be better than the num-one% to num-two% assumption.
based on the num-one% to num-two% organic sales decline, we believe a low double-digit to low-teen decremental margin is an appropriate benchmark to use for our second quarter.
