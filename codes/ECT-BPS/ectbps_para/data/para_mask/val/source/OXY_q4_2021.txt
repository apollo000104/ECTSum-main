it was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable balance due to higher commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, an increase in inventories, including a higher number of barrels on the water at year-end.
we are pleased to implement this new framework, beginning with an increase in the quarterly common dividend to $num-one per share.
as we expect net debt to fall below $num-one billion by the end of the first quarter, our focus has expanded to returning capital to shareholders, beginning with the increase in our common dividend to $num-two per share and the reactivation and expansion of our share repurchase program.
the increase in the dividend to $num-one per share is consistent with our intention to initially increase the dividend to a level that approximates the yield of the s&p num-two.
as vicki mentioned, the first phase of our shareholder return framework consists of the debt reduction; an increase in the common dividend to $num-one per share; and the reactivation, expansion of our share repurchase program.
in addition to increasing the common dividend to $num-one per share, we intend to purchase approximately $num-two billion of outstanding shares of common stock.
