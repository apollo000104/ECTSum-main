adjusting for certain items, primarily the mark-to-market of hedging instruments and the gain on sale properties in the previously announced divestiture, we had adjusted net income of $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share as compared to $num-three million or $num-four per share for the previous quarter.
we find ourselves in an enviable financial position, whereby we expect to have no debt and be cash positive before the end of year-six.
