We continued this momentum into July, ending the month with Chili's down just 10.9%.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share are currently estimated to be a loss in the range of $0.25 to $0.40.
For Brinker in the first quarter, we expect consolidated comp store sales to be down in the low to mid-teens range.
I have every confidence we will continue to demonstrate our ability to sustain our progress and return to growth on the top and bottom line for the long term.
Despite our operators reducing year-over-year spend in this area by more than $29 million, we recorded meaningful savings in advertising spend, repair and maintenance and supplies related to on-premise dining, a portion of which we believe will be ongoing.
Our P&L highlights for the quarter were total revenues of $563 million, a restaurant operating margin of 6.4% and an adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.88.
Included in the $0.88 loss is a burden of approximately $0.18 due to the timing of recording expenses related to annual and long-term incentive compensation plans beyond what would typically be recorded in the fourth quarter in our G&A expense.
