First-quarter earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.11.
Moving on to our revised guidance for 2021.
First-quarter earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.11.
First-quarter sales were up 39% on a GAAP and adjusted basis versus the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share was $2.30, which was up significantly over last year's first quarter.
First-quarter North American retail sales were up a robust 70%, continuing the unprecedented levels of growth.
We continue to see an expanding customer base, with new customers growing 70% in Q1.
Both Indian and Slingshot's first-quarter retail was strong as well, collectively finishing up over 70% and market share increased about 3 percentage points.
Given the stronger-than-anticipated performance in the first quarter, we have increased our total company sales growth guidance and now expect sales to increase in the 18% to 21% range for the year, up from the 13% to 16% we guided in January.
We are also increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2021 and now expect earnings to be in the range of $9 to $9.25 per diluted share.
