Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter was $87.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $79.3 million, or $0.76 per diluted share in Q3 of last year.
Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter was $87.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $79.3 million, or $0.76 per diluted share in Q3 of last year.
Net income on a GAAP basis in the third quarter was $67.3 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $39.6 million or $0.38 per diluted share in last year's Q3.
So to summarize, our scenario for total revenue in Q4 is a range of $225 million to $255 million.
Based on a combination of the factors I just reviewed, we estimate the Q4 diluted earnings per share on the GAAP basis could range from five -- from about $0.05 to about $0.20; and then on a non-GAAP basis, we estimate, it would range from about $0.22 to $0.37.

And as for the full-year, if you do the math, that would mean that our FY '20 revenue for the full-year could range from $1,115 million to $1,145 million; GAAP diluted earnings per share could range from $2.04 to $2.19; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could range from $2.76 to $2.91.
