Similarly, our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.56 is up significantly from Q2's $0.21, while it is flat to last year as a result of the additional shares issued at close of the Combination.
For the fourth quarter, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be in the ballpark of the third quarter, and for the full year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to exceed $215 million.
Looking ahead, we anticipate that throughout the next year or two, our markets will show gradual sequential improvement.
