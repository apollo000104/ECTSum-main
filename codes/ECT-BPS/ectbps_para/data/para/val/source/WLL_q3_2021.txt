Adjusting for certain items, primarily the mark-to-market of hedging instruments and the gain on sale properties in the previously announced divestiture, we had adjusted net income of $142 million or $3.57 per diluted share as compared to $118 million or $3.01 per share for the previous quarter.
We find ourselves in an enviable financial position, whereby we expect to have no debt and be cash positive before the end of 2021.
