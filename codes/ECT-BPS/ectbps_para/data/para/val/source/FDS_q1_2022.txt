GAAP earnings per share increased 7% to $2.79 this quarter versus $2.62 in the prior year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.25 driven higher -- by higher revenues and a lower tax rate.
FactSet is off to a strong start to fiscal 2022, and I'm pleased to share that this quarter, had the highest Q1 incremental ASV on record.
