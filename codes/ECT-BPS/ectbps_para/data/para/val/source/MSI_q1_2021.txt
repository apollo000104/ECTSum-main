Our Q1 results included revenue of $1.8 billion, up 7%, including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 compared to $1.12 in the year ago quarter.
We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion, up 8% versus last year.
