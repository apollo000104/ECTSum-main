I'm pleased to announce that despite the financial impact of COVID-19 and the extended tax season, our Board of Directors has declared a $0.26 per share dividend payable July 1.
As we announced in late March, we believe we have sufficient funds to support the business at the start of tax season '21.
We recorded a $106 million non-cash goodwill impairment at Wave due to the pandemic and its impact on small businesses.
