We also set two additional quarterly company records: we generated the highest quarterly home closing gross margin of 29.7% in company history as a result of pricing power, more than offsetting the elevated lumber and other commodity costs; and our quarterly diluted earnings per share of $5.25 was the highest in our company's history.

Higher closing volume, pricing power, expanded gross margin and the improved overhead leverage that we achieved this quarter all led to the 85% year-over-year increase in third quarter diluted earnings per share of $5.25.
With more than 5,800 units in backlog and another almost 2,800 specs in the ground today, we are projecting 12,600 to 12,900 home closings for the full year of 2021, which we anticipate will generate $5.05 billion to $5.15 billion in home closing revenue.
With an increase to the projected effective tax rate to 23%, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $18.75 to $19.40 for 2021, a year-over-year increase of over 70%.
Our third quarter closings totaled 3,112 homes. The 10% year-over-year home closing revenue growth to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2021 was the result of the 4% increase in home closings and 7% higher closing ASP despite the mix shift to more entry-level products.
