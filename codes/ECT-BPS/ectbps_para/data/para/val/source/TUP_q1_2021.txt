The improvements in the operations, higher sales and higher margins led to a GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.85.
Our first-quarter sales were 460 million, which was an increase of 20% compared with last year in local currency and up 22% on a reported basis.

For the first quarter, the improvements in gross margin and SG&A that I just discussed, combined with our contribution margin on the 20% sales growth resulted in an adjusted operating income of 75.3 million or 16.4% of sales, which reflects a significant improvement of 1,290 basis points versus prior year.
And adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 also improved significantly compared to just $0.09 last year.
