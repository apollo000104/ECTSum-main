As I noted earlier, our adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 was in line with our expectations despite higher-than-expected inflation.
The impact of the volume decline was partially offset by a 2.7% benefit from favorable mix and the initial pricing actions we took in response to the elevated inflationary environment, which I will describe in further detail shortly.
Organic net sales growth is expected to be roughly flat to fiscal '21.
Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 16%, and adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.50.
For fiscal '22, we now expect organic net sales growth approximately flat to fiscal '21, adjusted operating margin of approximately 16%, and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $2.50.
Second, the largest driver of the change is the significant $0.41 per share increase in inflation since Q3 that I just discussed.
