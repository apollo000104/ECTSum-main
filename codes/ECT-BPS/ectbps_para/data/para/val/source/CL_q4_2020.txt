So now I'll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond.
We expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%.
We expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range.
We expect our gross profit margin to be up year over year in 2021 despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials, and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID.
