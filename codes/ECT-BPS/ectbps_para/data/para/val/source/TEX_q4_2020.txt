Finally, our reported earnings per share of $0.21 per share includes the adverse operating impact on gross profit and SG&A, offset by the favorable benefits in other income that I just discussed.
Now I would like to update you on how we currently anticipate 2021 to develop financially.
The Board has approved a Q1 dividend of $0.12 per share as we return cash to shareholders.
We anticipate earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.35 per share based on sales of approximately $3.45 billion.
