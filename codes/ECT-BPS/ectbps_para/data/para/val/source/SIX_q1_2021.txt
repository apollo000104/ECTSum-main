Revenue in the quarter was down $46 million or 36% to $82 million.
We expect our full-year 2021 capital spend to be slightly lower than 2020 due to the carryover of new rights that were delivered and paid for, but not commission in 2020.
On the cost side, cash operating and SG&A expenses versus 2019 decreased by $29 million or 20% primarily due to the following.
Through this past weekend our year-to-date attendance trends have accelerated at our open parks increasing to 79% of 2019 levels compared to 51% in the 4th quarter of 2020.
Net cash outflow for the quarter was $95 million representing an average of $32 million per month.
GAAP loss per share was $1.12 compared to a loss of $0.82 in 2019, primarily due to the lower attendance in our parks.
This compares to a liquidity position of $618 million as of December 31, 2020.
Looking ahead, we expect the active pass base trends to continue to improve as we have begun selling new season passes and memberships.
