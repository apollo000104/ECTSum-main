As reported, sales of $280.8 million in the fourth quarter, increased 1.7% year over year.
The reduction in our normalized tax rate assumption for 2022 results from the portfolio actions completed late in 2021 which tilt our portfolio to a higher portion of earnings in the United States.
Taking into consideration all the factors that we know at this time, we expect low double-digit revenue growth over reported 2021 sales of $1.14 billion and we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $263 million to $275 million, implying adjusted EBITDA margins north of 20%.
Further, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.70 to $7.25 using a normalized 27% tax rate, reduced from 30% last year.
