In sum, we enter 2022 with heightened confidence in our ability to execute upon the objectives we set forth in late November.
For example, performance in two key elements of our growth strategy, accelerating the transition of patients to Optum-led value-based care and strong United Healthcare growth in serving Medicare Advantage consumers, are both tracking well with the expectations we shared with you at our recent investor conference.
Full year '21 cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion or 1.3 times net income, about $2 billion above the initial outlook we shared a year ago.
