Turning to Slide 6, on a consolidated basis, our sales increased to a record $1.65 billion up 2.7% over a strong fiscal 2021 first quarter, which grew 9.1%.
I'll now move on to Slide 11, as we look ahead to our fiscal 2022 second quarter we anticipate that raw material, trade, and wage inflation will persist.
We expect our fiscal 2022 second-quarter consolidated sales to increase in the mid-single digits.
However, in a similar manner to the first quarter, we expect the consumer segment's second-quarter sales to be above its pre-pandemic level, which is a fair comparison.
