For the first quarter, we anticipate revenue in the range of $510-530 million, which will represent another record quarter for Fabrinet.
In addition to record revenue, we also delivered record non-GAAP operating margins of 9.9%, resulting in an all-time high non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.31 in the fourth quarter.
We also executed very well, hit our highest gross margin in four years, and record operating margins to produce non-GAAP earnings of $1.31 per share, which also exceeded our guidance.
On a GAAP basis, net income was also a record at $42.4 million or $1.13 per diluted share.
From a profitability perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.36 per diluted share.
