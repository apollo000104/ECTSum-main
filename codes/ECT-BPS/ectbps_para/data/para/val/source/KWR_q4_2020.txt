Excluding similar cost adjustments of Q4, we estimate our gross margins in 2020 and 2019 would have been 36.3% and 35.7% respectively.
And I look forward to continuing to be involved in the company's bright future as Chairman of the Board following my retirement.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.63 for Q4 is up 22% from $1.34 in Q4 of '19, due primarily to the improved operating income I discussed earlier.
