This momentum continues into Q4.
At the end of the quarter, inventory was up 9.1% to last year, driven by our supply chain and logistics team efforts to position us well for the upcoming holiday season combined with the inventory that was included in the WSS acquisition.
We believe we are well positioned for the holiday season in terms of both strong customer demand and inventory levels to support that demand.
