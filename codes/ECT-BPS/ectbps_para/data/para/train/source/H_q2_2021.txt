Late yesterday, we reported a second quarter net loss attributable to Hyatt up $9 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.08.
Consistent with our communication in the first quarter, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A to be in the approximate range of $240 million excluding any bad debt expense.
Further, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $110 million.
As of June 30, our total liquidity inclusive of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and combined with borrowing capacity was approximately $3.2 billion with the only near-term debt maturity being $250 million senior notes maturing this month.
We received a $254 million US tax refund in July related to 2020 net operating losses carried back to prior years under the CARES Act.
