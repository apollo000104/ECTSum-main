The midpoint of the updated guidance at $6.05 is above our prior peak pre-COVID adjusted earnings per share of $6.02 in 2019.
We finished the second quarter with record adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.83, up 205% compared to last year and record adjusted operating margins of 17.6%.
Based on this performance, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance by $0.30 to a range of $5.95 to $6.15, which is effectively our fourth guidance increase so far this year.
As Max explained, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.30 to a range of $5.95 to $6.15, reflecting the strong second quarter performance and our expectation that end markets and execution will be ahead of where we forecasted them earlier this year.
The midpoint of the updated guidance at $6.05 is above our prior peak pre-COVID adjusted earnings per share of $6.02 in 2019.
At our May Aerospace & Electronics investor event, we showed you numerous examples of how we continue to effectively drive above-market growth, expecting 7% to 9% compound average growth over the next 10 years.
Taken together, and as we explained at our Aerospace Investor Day in May, we expect a long-term overall compound annual growth rate of 7% to 9% through 2030.
Our revised guidance assumes core sales growth of 7% to 9%, which is 200 basis points higher than our prior May 24 guidance.
