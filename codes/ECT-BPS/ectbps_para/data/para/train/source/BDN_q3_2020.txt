As Tom will articulate in more detail, we did post FFO of $0.35 per share, which is in line with consensus estimates.
Our third quarter net income totaled $274.4 million or $1.60 per diluted share and FFO totaled $60 million or $0.35 per diluted share.
Our third quarter net income totaled $274.4 million or $1.60 per diluted share and FFO totaled $60 million or $0.35 per diluted share.
We've collected over 99% of our third quarter billings and our October collection rate continues to track very, very well with over 97% of office rents collected as of yesterday.
Additionally, if we included third quarter deferrals, our core portfolio would have been very strong 97%.
Collections for October are currently 97% however, one vendor payment anticipated to be received in the next day or so will bring us up to 95% -- 99%.
No NOI will be generated in 2020.
