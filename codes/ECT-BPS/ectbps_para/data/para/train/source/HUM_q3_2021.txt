Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.83 for the third quarter and updated full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated COVID headwind resulting from our current view of utilization levels for the balance of the year.
Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.83 for the third quarter of 2021, slightly above consensus estimates.

This update reflects a more conservative posture going into the final months of the year and notably $21.50 remains the baseline of which to grow for 2022.
And notably $21.50 remains the baseline of which to grow for 2022.
Taken together, our updated full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance takes a more conservative posture going into the final months of 2021, and it's important to note as we've consistently shared throughout the year the midpoint of our original guidance range of $21.50 remains the correct baseline for 2022 given our approach to pricing.
As previously mentioned, I want to reiterate that the $21.50 midpoint of our original 2021 guide continues to be the appropriate jumping-off point for 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth given our approach to pricing.
We have refined our full year individual Medicare Advantage membership guidance to up approximately 450,000 members consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance of up 425,000 to 475,000 members.
In September 2021 as a result of the surge in COVID cases due to the Delta variant, we updated our commentary on full year guidance to indicate we expected non-COVID Medicare Advantage utilization to be 5.5% below baseline in the back half of the year, while being partially offset by 3% of COVID costs, therefore, again assuming total utilization would be 2.5% below baseline in the back half of 2021.
Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic we expect to enter the year with an appropriately conservative view of our initial 2022 financial outlook.
As Susan will share in more detail, this reduction of approximately $1 in adjusted earnings per share is a direct result of COVID and corresponds to our current expectation of the total Medicare Advantage utilization inclusive of COVID costs will run 1% below baseline in the fourth quarter, which is a 150 basis points less than our previous assumption of 2.5% below baseline.
What we've seen develop for the third quarter is that total utilization is running 1% below baseline versus the previously anticipated 2.5%.
As COVID hospitalizations increased or decreased we continue to see an approximate 1-to-1 offset in non-COVID hospitalization levels.
However, for the third quarter, in total we saw 1% incremental reduction in utilization beyond the level needed to offset COVID costs versus the 2.5% contemplated in our previous guide.
As a result, we have adjusted our full year guide to now reflect the fourth quarter running similarly with total Medicare Advantage utilization running 1% below baseline inclusive of estimated COVID costs, consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter.
