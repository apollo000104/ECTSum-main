And as a result, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.51 in for the third quarter, an increase of 10% versus 2019.
Today, our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage levels remains at the low end of our target range of three to 4 times.
More specifically, at the end of the third quarter of 2021, the company had over $1 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity through its revolving credit facility.
We currently expect full year domestic RevPAR to surpass 2019 levels and grow at approximately 1% as compared to full year 2019.
Assuming the broader RevPAR and economy recovery trends continue, we now expect to see our 2021 adjusted EBITDA exceed 2019 levels and range between $382 million and $387 million, even with planned incremental investments in the fourth quarter.
