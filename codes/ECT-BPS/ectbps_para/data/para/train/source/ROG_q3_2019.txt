In addition ongoing trade tensions are generating headwinds and in some cases limiting near-term demand visibility from a market perspective industrial and conventional automotive demand which had begun to slow in late Q2 weakened further in the third quarter.
Based upon customer and industry analyst inputs we expect the recent pause in the 5G rollout to continue through the end of the year and believe that China 5G deployments will rebound in the first half of 2020.

As a result we guided GAAP Q4 loss in the range of $1.43 to $1.28 per share.
On an adjusted basis we guide the fully diluted earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.15 per share for the fourth quarter.
