With all of that considered, we expect reported operating income to reach approximately 5 to 25 million and adjusted operating income to be approximately 130 to 150 million, which will take us to a reported diluted loss per share of about $0.18 to $0.20 or adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.12 to $0.14.
