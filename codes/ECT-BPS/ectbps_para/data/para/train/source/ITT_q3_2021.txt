As a result of the revenue growth, continued margin expansion and the effective deployment of the balance sheet, ITT delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.99, growing 21% over the prior year.
We achieved an adjusted trailing 12-month free cash flow margin of more than 11% this quarter, due to higher segment operating income.
Nevertheless, in 2021, we expect to comfortably exceed pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share levels.
We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.01 to $4.06 at the high end, which equates to 25% to 27% growth versus prior year.
