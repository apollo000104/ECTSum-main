Sales of $239 million were down 3% versus prior year, a continued sequential improvement from the third quarter, when year-over-year sales were down 11%.
Adjusted free cash flow declined by $3 million versus the prior year.
Our 2020 acquisitions added a net $3 million adjusted EBITDA benefit and delivered a 27% adjusted EBITDA margin.
And that said, I also believe we can improve.
We anticipate revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.06 billion, or up 10% to 13% versus prior year.
Sales were up $6 million or 13% as the 2020 acquisitions of Turf, Moz and just recently, Arktura, contributed $11 million in the quarter and offset COVID-driven organic sales decline of 9%.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow 9% to 13% as the benefits of sales growth falls through and we continue to drive productivity in our plants and benefit from improved results at WAVE.
