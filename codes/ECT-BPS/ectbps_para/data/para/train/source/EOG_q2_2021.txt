We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and nearly $1.1 billion of free cash flow, repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last quarter.
We have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021. We now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year.
Once again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results.
