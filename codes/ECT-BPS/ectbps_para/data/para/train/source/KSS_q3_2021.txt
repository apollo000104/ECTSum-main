And earnings per share to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.30.
Net income for the quarter was $243 million, and earnings per diluted share was a Q3 record of $1.65.
Turning to our guidance outlook for 2021.
Based on our strong third quarter performance, we are raising our full year outlook and are guiding as follows: net sales to increase in the mid-20s percentage range, up from our prior expectation of low 20s percentage increase.
And earnings per share to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.30.
And third, we are accelerating our share repurchase activity, reinforcing our commitment to driving shareholder value, and now expect to repurchase $1.3 billion for the year.
Year to date, we have generated operating cash flow of $1.8 billion and free cash flow of $1.3 billion.
We plan on continuing our accelerated share repurchase activity with an additional $500 million in Q4, bringing our total for the year to $1.3 billion.
We see a lot of value in our company and believe repurchases are a great mechanism to return capital to shareholders, given our promising outlook and formidable cash position of $1.9 billion.
We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding balance on our revolver.
