I'm pleased with our Q2 fiscal 2022 performance with revenue of $3.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $1.75 per share.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 29.4%, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 on a share count of 423 million diluted shares.
We remain on track to spin-off from Dell in early November of this year.
