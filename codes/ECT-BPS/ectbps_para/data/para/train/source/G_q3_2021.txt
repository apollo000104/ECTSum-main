Total revenue was $1.02 billion, up 9% year-over-year or 8% on a constant currency basis.
We continue to expect total revenue between $3.96 billion and $4 billion, representing year-over-year constant currency growth of 5.5% to 6.5%.
Given the outlook I just provided, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.43, up from the prior $2.36 to $2.39 range due to the favorable impact of the nonrecurring tax benefit as well as the balance sheet remeasurement gains during the quarter.
