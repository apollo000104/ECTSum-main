Diluted adjusted earnings per share were $1.58, representing 68% growth over the prior year.
The strength of our operating earnings and capital actions in the quarter helped drive a near 10% adjusted annualized ROE and growth in adjusted tangible book value per share of nearly $7, which represents a sequential increase of 12% and a full year increase of 23%.
Catastrophe losses of $189 million were significantly lower this quarter, compared to $545 million in the prior-year quarter.

We're executing on multiple workstreams to operationally separate the business, and we closed on the sale of 9.9% equity stake and transferred $50 billion of assets under management to Blackstone.
When analyzing the portfolio over the last five years, we've seen catastrophe levels that are 10 times the level the portfolio dealt with in the prior 10 years for losses in excess of $50 million.
We also made excellent progress with Blackstone in the fourth quarter, completing the initial $50 billion asset transfer, incorporating them into our asset-liability management process, finalizing the investment guidelines, and developing initial product offerings based on Blackstone's origination platform.
We continue to expect to retain a greater-than-50% interest immediately following the IPO and to continue to consolidate life retirement's financial statements at least until such time as we fall below the 50% ownership threshold.
Overall global commercial Insurance net premiums grew 13% on a reported and constant dollar basis for the quarter, and growth in North America commercial was 11%, driven by casualty, which increased 50%; Lexington, which increased 14%; and financial lines, which increased over 10%.
In addition to closing Blackstone transactions, we also continue to make significant progress on operationally separating life retirement from AIG, both with respect to what can be done by the IPO and longer-term to transition service agreements.
We continue to work toward an IPO in the second quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions.

We expect that over time, this business will sustain a payout ratio to shareholders of 60% to 65% between dividends and share repurchases on a full calendar year basis.
We also expect that post IPO, life and retirement will pay an annual dividend in the range of $400 million to $600 million, which equates to roughly a 2% to 3% yield on book value.
Additionally, as part of the separation process, in the fourth quarter of 2021, life and retirement declared a dividend payable to AIG in the amount of $8.3 billion, which will be funded by life and retirement debt issuances and paid prior to the IPO.
Post deconsolidation, we expect life retirement to maintain a leverage ratio in the high 20s, with AIG maintaining a leverage ratio in the low 20s.
We do not expect the life retirement IPO to impact AIG's dividend and expect to maintain our current annual dividend level at $1.28 per share.
Adjusted pre-tax income in the fourth quarter and full year was $969 million and $3.9 billion, respectively.
With respect to share buybacks, we have $3.9 billion remaining under our current authorization and expect to complete this amount in 2022, weighted more toward the first half of this year.
On a full year basis, APTI increased to $3.9 billion, reflecting higher net investment income and fee income, partially offset by adverse mortality.
