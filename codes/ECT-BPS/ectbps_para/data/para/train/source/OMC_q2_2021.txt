Net income was $348 million in the second quarter, an increase of 75% from the second quarter of 2020 and earnings per share was $1.60 per share, an increase of 74%.
As a result, our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.60 versus the loss of $0.11 per share we reported in Q2 of 2020.
While it is still too early to measure our progress, I'm pleased to report that a preliminary review of our employee diversity in the United States shows a meaningful increase in the number of diverse employees as of June 30th, 2021 compared to the end of 2020.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.9%, up significantly from Q2 2020 even after excluding the gain on the sale of ICON in the current period and adding back the repositioning charge recorded in Q2 of 2020. As for our debt ratios, as a result of our overall operating improvement versus Q2 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt to EBITDA ratio to 2.2 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 0.4 times.
Organic growth for the second quarter was a positive 24.4%.
Organic growth for the quarter was 24.4% or $682 million, which represents a significant increase compared to Q2 of 2020 which reflected the onset of the pandemic when revenue declined by 23% or $855 million.
In addition to our organic revenue growth of 24.4% for the quarter, the impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 5.4% in the quarter, higher than we anticipated entering the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year.
Our organic growth of $682 million or 24.4% in the second quarter reflects strong performance across all of our major geographic markets and across all of our service disciplines.
