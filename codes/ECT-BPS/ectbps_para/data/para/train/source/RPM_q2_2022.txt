Adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 decreasing 26% compared to the strong adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of nearly 40% in the prior-year period.
For the fiscal 2022 second quarter, consolidated sales increased 10.3% to $1.64 billion driven by continued robust demand for paints, coatings, sealants, and other building materials.
In spite of these challenges, we expect to generate double-digit consolidated sales growth in the fiscal 2022 third quarter versus last year's record third quarter sales, which increased 8.1%.
We anticipate that earnings will be affected by ongoing raw material, freight, and wage inflation, as well as the impact of raw materials shortages, on sales volume, plus the renewed COVID disruption from the surging Omicron variant.
