We're reaffirming our 2022 earnings per share guidance range of $8.10 to $8.70 per share, and we're introducing our 2023 earnings per share guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20 per share.
And finally, we're announcing a projected long-term earnings per share growth rate for the company of 6% to 8%.
But at a high level, our projected growth of 6% to 8% is supported by strong continued investment at Sempra California to support safety, reliability and the state's ambitious energy transition goals; investment in our Texas utilities to support strong economic growth and a significant interconnection queue loaded with renewables; and, disciplined investments at Sempra Infrastructure for fully contracted assets currently under construction; and, potential upside to projected growth from projects we currently have in development.
Our historical execution, combined with the growth opportunities in front of us, give us confidence in providing a long-term earnings per share growth rate of an annual average of 6% to 8% starting at the midpoint of 2022 earnings per share guidance through 2026.
This 6% to 8% growth is driven by our five-year capital plan and continued operational excellence across our businesses.
