MDC delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2020, highlighted by fully diluted earnings per share of $2.19, representing a 54% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019.
As a result, overall net income increased 59% to $147.5 million or $2.19 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020.
The average selling price of homes delivered during the quarter increased 2% to about $461,000 and 61% of the units we closed were a part of our more affordable collections.
As a result of the strong sales we just discussed, we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value for our homes in backlog of $3.26 billion, which was up 87% year-over-year and, as Larry mentioned, was our highest year-end backlog dollar value ever.
To that end, our current target for home deliveries in 2021 is between 10,000 and 11,000 units.
We are anticipating home deliveries for the first quarter of 2021 to reach between 2,200 and 2,400 units.
