Turning to our dividend, given our performance, I am pleased to report that our Board approved an increase of 5.4% to $0.39 per share in our quarterly dividend. We remain committed to optimizing our portfolio and continue to anticipate redevelopment opportunities over the next five years, possibly involving between 5% and 10% of our current portfolio with targeted unlevered -- unlevered redevelopment program yields of greater than 10%.
