Due to economic uncertainty, we have withdrawn our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2020.
Net earnings totaled $73 million for the quarter or $0.42 per diluted share.
After adjusting for the impact of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, net earnings totaled $65 million or $0.38 per diluted share.
In conclusion, we expect the short term to be difficult with continuing declines in revenue and profitability.
Our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong.
