As a result, revenue declined by $458 million or 96% to $19 million.
We will focus on revenue generation and cost efficiency programs in our base business as we become a more agile, commercially driven and technology savvy organization.
The purpose of this element is to enhance the guest and team member experience while creating cost efficiencies.
However, we will not finalize the cost of associated savings until we complete the work.
We anticipate that a portion of the work will be completed by the fourth quarter of 2020, and the remaining portion will be completed when the parts are again operating at more normal capacity.
Since we opened our parks, we have begun to sell new memberships and season passes.
Guest spending per capita in the quarter decreased 15% to $35.77.
We are taking members on pause as we open our parks, and we anticipate that most of our pause members will return to active paying members once we reopen our remaining parks.
And third, we offer the pause payments for any member requesting to do so.
Our Active Pass Base as of the end of the second quarter was down 38% and compared to the prior year quarter.
This included $460 million of available revolver capacity, net of $21 million of letters of credit and $296 million of cash.
We believe we have adequate liquidity to the end of 2021 even if we need to close our parks.
However, if operations remain curtailed, we will likely need a further amendment to our senior secured leverage ratio covenant.
