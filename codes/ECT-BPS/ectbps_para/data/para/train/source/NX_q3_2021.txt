We reported net sales of $279.9 million during the third quarter of 2021, which represents an increase of 32%, compared to $212.1 million during the third quarter of 2020.
We reported net income of $13.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the three months ended July 31, 2021, compared to $10.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the three months ended July 31, 2020.
However, we do expect inflation, labor costs, and supply chain challenges to continue pressuring margins throughout the fourth quarter of this year.
In summary, on a consolidated basis, we are reaffirming net sales guidance of approximately $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $125 million to $130 million in fiscal 2021.
