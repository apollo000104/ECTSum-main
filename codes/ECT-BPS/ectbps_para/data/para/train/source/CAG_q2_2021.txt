We delivered organic net sales growth of 8.1%, adjusted operating margin of 19.6%, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.81.
And our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 28.6% to $0.81 for the second quarter.
EPS increased 28.6% to $0.81.
Given these sales and margin factors along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third-quarter adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.56 to $0.60.
Lastly, we are reaffirming all metrics of our fiscal '22 guidance which also excludes the impact of the pending sale of Peter Pan.
Given these sales and margin factors along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third-quarter adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.56 to $0.60.
For the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus 6% to 8%.
We do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year.
