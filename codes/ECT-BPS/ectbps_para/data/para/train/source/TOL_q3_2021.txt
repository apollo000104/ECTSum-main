Both our pre-tax income of $303.4 million and our earnings per share of $1.87 more than doubled compared to last year.
Net income was $234.9 million or $1.87 per share diluted compared to $114.8 million and $0.90 per share diluted one year ago.
So we now project our fourth quarter deliveries to be approximately 3,450 homes.
