Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.57, including a discrete tax benefit of $0.80 per share.
On that basis, this quarter represents same-store sales growth of 38.1%. That's a same-store sales improvement of 97.4% compared to last year.
For the fiscal year, we now expect total sales within range of $6.8 billion to $6.95 billion with same-store sales in the range of 30% to 33% and non-GAAP EBIT of $618 million to $673 million.
We expect third-quarter sales in the range of $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion, with same-store sales in the range of down 3% to up 1% and non-GAAP EBIT of $10 million to $25 million.
On the value end of the mid-market, we've continued the rollout of our rebranding test, Banter by Piercing Pagoda, that we began in 100 stores at the end of April.
Our total sales of $1.8 billion reflect growth of more than 100% over last year.
As we continue to optimize our footprint, we remain on track to open up to 100 locations and close at least 100.
