As we noted on our Q1 earnings call, April was down approximately 30%, this was followed by slightly better volumes in May and then relatively strong finish in June, which was down, let's call it low double-digits.
Segment margins were 14.7%, down 110 basis points from Q1 and our detrimental margins were at 25%, 5 points better than our guidance of 30%.
For Q2, revenues were down 32%, with a 30% decline organically and a 2% currency impact.
And Vehicle, we project revenues will decline between 30% and 34%.
For Q3 and full year, we expect decremental margins of between 25% and 30% and for Q3, we expect our tax rate on adjusted earnings to be between 15% and 16%.
And Vehicle, we project revenues will decline between 30% and 34%. Our Q2 revenues were $3.9 billion, down 22% organically.
Q2 earnings on a per share basis were $0.13 on a GAAP basis and $0.70 on adjusted basis, which excludes $0.20 of charges related to acquisitions and divestitures and $0.37 related to the multi-year restructuring program that we just announced.
Our Q2 revenues were $3.9 billion, down 22% organically.
We would expect to realize $200 million of mature-year benefits from these actions once they are fully implemented and we think full year implementation is 2023.
Both very strong results and which gives us the ability to really reaffirm our free cash flow guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion and a midpoint of $2.5 billion.
We're maintaining our free -- 2020 free cash flow guidance, the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion and I would note that this range does in fact, include now the impact related to the multi-year restructuring program that we announced, and that was not in our prior guidance.
