Total operating revenues for the third quarter were $1.016 billion, a decrease of $11 million or 1% year-over-year.
As I commented earlier, total operating revenues were $1.016 billion, a 1% decrease year-over-year.
Also in the quarter, we completed fiber to the home construction in our Southern Wisconsin cluster where we are seeing total broadband penetration of 38% in the fully launched cluster.
For example, we are experiencing a 38% video attachment rate to every broadband connection in our wireline market where we offer IPTV services.
