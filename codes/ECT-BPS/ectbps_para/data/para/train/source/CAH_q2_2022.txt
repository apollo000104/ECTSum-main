The net result for the quarter was earnings per share of $1.29.
Beginning with total company results; first quarter revenue increased 13% to $44 billion, driven by sales growth from existing customers.
We are taking action to mitigate these impacts across the enterprise and we are reaffirming our FY '22 earnings per share guidance of $5.60 to $5.90 per share.
We are reiterating our earnings per share guidance range of $5.60 to $5.90 per share.
And as noted last quarter, we still expect the cadence of our earnings per share guidance to be significantly back half-weighted.
And with our improved balance sheet, commitment to our dividend and now an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization, we're positioned to return capital to shareholders.
Our Board recently approved a new three year authorization to repurchase up to an additional $3 billion of our common stock, expiring at the end of calendar year 2024.
These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segments, our commitment to our dividend and our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization.
Given the anticipated timing of realizing these cost increases and our mitigating actions, as well as the timing of selling higher-cost PPE, we expect a sequential decline in Medical segment profit in the second quarter.
