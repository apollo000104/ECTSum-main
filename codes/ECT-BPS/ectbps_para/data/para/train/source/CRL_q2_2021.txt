Earnings per share were $2.61 in the second quarter, an increase of 65.2% from $1.58 in the second quarter of last year.
Organic revenue growth of 24.1%, including 8% related to last year's COVID-19 impact and operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, were the primary drivers behind earnings-per-share growth share growth of 65.2% to $2.61.
