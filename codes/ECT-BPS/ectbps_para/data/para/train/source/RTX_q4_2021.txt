As you saw in December, our board of directors also authorized a $6 billion share repurchase program, positioning us to continue returning significant capital to shareowners, including at least $2.5 billion of repurchases that we expect to complete in 2022.
And as Greg mentioned, we expect to buyback at least $2.5 billion of RTX shares over the year , subject to market conditions.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by commercial aftermarket strength at both Collins and Pratt, as well as favorability in our effective tax rate.
On a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.46 per share and included $0.62 of acquisition accounting adjustments, and net significant and/or non-recurring items.
At Pratt, the team introduced the GTF Advantage engine, which reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by a total of 17% compared to the prior generation engines.
Sales of $17 billion were in line with our expectations and were up 4% organically versus prior year on an adjusted basis.
By channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 47%, driven by a 59% increase in parts and repair, a 52% in provisioning, and a 17% increase in modification and upgrades.
Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 17%.
And that strategy, of course, is to drive top-line growth, margin expansion, and robust free cash flows through 2025 and beyond while at the same time continuing to invest in our businesses and returning significant capital to shareowners.
At the RTX level, we expect full year 2022 sales of between $68.5 billion and $69.5 billion.
From an earnings perspective, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.80, up 8% to 12% year over year, and we expect to generate free cash flow of about $6 billion.
All of this brings us to our outlook range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share.
Our continued focus on operational excellence and program execution, along with our industry leading technologies, positions us well to continue to capitalize on the commercial aerospace recovery and to grow our defense franchises.
