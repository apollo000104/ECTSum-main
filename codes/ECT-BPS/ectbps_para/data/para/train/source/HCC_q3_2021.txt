We believe we are well positioned to fulfill our customer volume commitments for 2021 of approximately 4.9 million to 5.5 million short tons through a combination of existing coal inventory and expected production during the fourth quarter.
In contrast, this year, our third quarter results were negatively impacted by the UMWA strike in which we idled Mine 4 and significantly reduced operations at Mine 7.
We incurred $9 million of expenses in the third quarter associated with the idiling of Mine 4 and reduced operations at Mine 7.
As a result of the ongoing UMWA strike that began April 1, we idled Mine 4 in the second quarter.
