We earned an adjusted $1.44 per diluted share for the second quarter.
On an adjusted basis, after adding back the impairment loss on goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is $1.44 as compared to the same reported at $1.49 in last year's quarter.
We are reporting a loss per diluted share of $1.52 as compared to earnings per diluted share in last year's second quarter of $1.49.
I think revenues will likely be $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion.
Subject to that main caveat, we are likely going to earn $5 to $5.50 diluted earnings per share this year on an adjusted basis adding back the impact of impairment.
During the second quarter, we identified certain indicators of impairment within those of our businesses that are highly dependent on the strength of the oil and gas and related industrial markets.
