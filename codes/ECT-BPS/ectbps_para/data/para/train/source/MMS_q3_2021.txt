As for the remainder of fiscal 2021, our expectation for the full year is for revenue to range between $4.2 billion and $4.25 billion and for diluted earnings per share to range between $4.65 and $4.75.
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $1.24 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.51.

With two months left to go in fiscal year 2021, it's natural for us to be looking toward next year when we expect to see not only macro trends, bringing improvement to our core programs, but also momentum through new programs, such as the UK Restart and additional clinical and digital IT services work afforded by Attain Federal and VES.

Assuming the midpoint of our new revenue guidance range and assuming 72 days DSO, we expect the cash from operations to be in the range of $425 million to $455 million for the full year.
We expect cash from operations to range between $425 million and $455 million and free cash flow between $375 million and $405 million for the fiscal year 2021.

COVID response work has contributed $860 million of revenue on a year-to-date basis, and our full year estimate is approximately $1 billion.
The cash realized from the Census contract and the COVID response work was significant to our ability to acquire both Attain Federal and VES and still maintain a total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio below 3:1.
The ratio of debt, net of allowed cash to pro forma EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, calculated in accordance with our credit agreement is 2.4:1.
Our stated aim is to use most of our free cash flow over the next few quarters to push this ratio closer to 2:1.
We target a dividend yield between 1% and 2% of our stock price.
Approximately $1 billion of the pipeline reduction is due to the UK Restart program award with the remainder largely a result of government delays or cancellation of work that pushes opportunities out past the 2-year horizon for pipeline reporting.
As Rick and I have cautioned this year, the COVID-19 work is tapering off quickly, while, with some exceptions like Australia, our core programs have not yet returned to their prepandemic activity levels.
