As a result, we've increased our full-year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted earnings per share target, and we now expect to be in the range of $10.15 to $10.45.
This reflects operating cash flow in the range of 2.4 to $2.6 billion and the capex spend previously outlined. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of 1.4 to $1.5 billion.
In fact, our strong performance to date gives us the confidence to increase guidance for our beer business as we now expect to achieve 9 to 11% net sales growth and 4 to 6% operating income growth for fiscal '22.
