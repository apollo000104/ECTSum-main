We generated $3.44 this quarter and that compares to $2.98 last year.
If you move to Slide 15, this is just a walk from the $2.98 to the $3.44 for the quarter and despite organic sales declining 6% and total sales declining 2.5%, adjusted segment operating income increased by $70 million or $0.11, that equated to $0.42 per share,so very strong operating beat for the quarter.
And then if you look at the remaining items, other expense was just $0.01, slightly higher, we had a higher effective tax rate that impacted us by $0.03 and finally slightly higher diluted shares resulted in a $0.02 impact, that's how we get to the $3.44.
Full-year effective tax rate, no change, we still expect that to be 23%, and for the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as reported basis is now $11.90 to $12.40 or $12.15 at the midpoint and on an adjusted per share basis, the guidance range is now $13.65 to $14.15 or $13.90, at the midpoint.
So, all-in, we came in flat and that's the first time in seven quarters, I believe that the numbers have been not negative.
If you go to Slide 6, we're going to talk about cash flow the cash flow quarter paid down $767 million of debt in a quarter.
So I'm not going to talk about on this really today, but their historical success factors that will continue on into the future.
Full-year effective tax rate, no change, we still expect that to be 23%, and for the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as reported basis is now $11.90 to $12.40 or $12.15 at the midpoint and on an adjusted per share basis, the guidance range is now $13.65 to $14.15 or $13.90, at the midpoint.
