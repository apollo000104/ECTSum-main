Revenue in the quarter was down $152 million or 58% to $109 million as a result of a 65% decline in attendance.
I would now like to give you an update on the progress of our transformation plan.
We expect to ramp up to the full amount of benefits as attendance grows to 2019 levels.
We estimate that our net cash outflow in the first quarter of 2021 will be higher than normal or approximately $53 million to $58 million per month.
We expect to maintain our annual capital expenditures at 9% to 10% of revenue.
In January alone, we realized more than $2 million of fixed cost value due to transformation, so we are well on track to achieve our estimated savings for 2021.
