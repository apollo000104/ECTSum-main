Beginning with our first quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.18, an increase of 24%, primarily due to exceptional operating income growth across our businesses.
So I will now turn to our fiscal 2021 guidance.
We delivered exceptional results driven by differentiated commercial solutions with revenues of $52.5 billion for the first fiscal quarter, representing growth of 10% year-over-year and our adjusted earnings per share increasing 24% versus the prior year quarter.
All other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021 remain unchanged.
