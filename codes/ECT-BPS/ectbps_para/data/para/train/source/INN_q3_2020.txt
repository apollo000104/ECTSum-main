Our extended stay hotels which comprise nearly 25% of our total guest rooms were also relative outperformers again during the third quarter, finishing with occupancy of more than 63% and exceeded 60% in each month of the quarter while achieving a 51% RevPAR premium to our overall portfolio. Occupancy increased each month of the quarter peaking at 47% in September, which led to third quarter RevPAR of $47, a 63.5% decline year-over-year, but that was a significant improvement from the second quarter RevPAR of $23.
