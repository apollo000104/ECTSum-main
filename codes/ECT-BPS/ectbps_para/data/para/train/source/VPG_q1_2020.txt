For a discussion of the risks associated with VPG's operations, we encourage you to refer to our SEC filings, especially the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our other recent SEC filings.
While the majority of VPG's facilities were able to continue operations due to the essential nature of our products, our two facilities in India and in China were more significantly impacted.
While this order has been extended to May 17, we received approval to resume partial operations on our India facility.
Assuming the full reopening of this facility on May 17, we expect that our Force Sensors revenues in the second quarter to be reduced by approximately $5 million to $7 million, which is reflected in our guidance.
Given the high degree of uncertainty in the macro environment, we are focused on what we can control, which are our key strategic initiatives, to both grow our business and to reduce our operating cost.
