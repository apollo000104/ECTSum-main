Adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 per share was also up meaningfully, increasing approximately 14% versus the prior year as we benefited from higher sales growth, gross margin favorability and a reduction in interest expense and share count.
But as of today, we anticipate Q1 revenues of $220 million or more.
This is applicable as we think about fiscal 2021 but in a very different way compared to prior years.
We also anticipate earnings per share of $0.70 or more for Q1 as our proactive expense management and cost timing are expected to more than offset the anticipated revenue decline as compared to the prior year.
