That brings third quarter 2021 earnings per share guidance to $1 to $1.10 on a GAAP basis and $1.10 to $1.20 as adjusted.
Altogether, we have raised our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.60 to $4.80 which excludes M&A and restructuring costs of $12 million to $14 million and the previously mentioned UK tax remeasurement in the second quarter.
Our GAAP earnings per share guidance of $4.15 to $4.35 is $0.05 below our previous guidance and primarily due to higher M&A related costs.
As a result, JBT reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.95 in the second quarter.
Corporate costs for the quarter are expected to be $13 million to $14 million, excluding approximately $4 million in M&A and restructuring costs. We have again raised top line guidance for FoodTech, forecasting a year-over-year gain of 10% to 12% organically with another 2% increase related to FX translation, that compares with our previous guidance of 9% to 11%.
