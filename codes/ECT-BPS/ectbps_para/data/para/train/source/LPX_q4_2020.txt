SmartSide revenue is trending seasonally higher than the fourth quarter, on pace for at least 35% growth compared to the first quarter of 2020.
We grew SmartSide revenue by 15% and $481 million of revenue and EBITDA from higher OSB prices and generated $659 million in operating cash flow.
Halfway through this first quarter of 2021, OSB prices are at least 15% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 on similar volumes.
Should these trends continue and absent COVID outbreaks or sudden reversals in logistics, raw material availability or OSB prices, we expect EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 to be at least $380 million.
