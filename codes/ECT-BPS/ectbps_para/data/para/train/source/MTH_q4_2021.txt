Pricing power expanded gross margin and improved overhead leverage, combined with lower outstanding share count, all led to the 57% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share to $6.25.
Given the long-range cycle times, our fourth quarter closings totaled 3,526 homes, which was down 6% over the challenging comps of prior year.
Total orders of 3,367 for the fourth quarter of 2021 reflected an increase of 6% year over year, driven by a 24% increase in average active community count, which was partially offset by the decrease in average absorptions.
The 6% year-over-year home closing revenue growth to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 was a result of a 13% increase in ASP due to strong market demand, even as we shifted our product mix toward entry-level homes.
We are already seeing increased volume from our higher community count and expect to continue to benefit from incremental orders and closings in 2022 and beyond.
For the full year 2022, we're projecting total closings to be between 14,500 and 15,500 units, home closing revenue of $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion, home closing gross margin around 27.75%, an effective tax rate of about 25%, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $23.15 to $24.65.
