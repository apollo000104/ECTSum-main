Earlier today we announced 2020 fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share.
Similar to inland, we expect coastal market conditions will improve as the year progresses, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of 2021.
In the near-term, we expect tough market conditions to persist into the second quarter particularly in Marine Transportation where industry barge utilization is very low and we are experiencing very competitive pricing dynamics.
