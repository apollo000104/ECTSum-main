Net income on a GAAP basis in the first quarter was $135.2 million or $1.30 per diluted share compared to $48.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share in last year's Q1.
As Lewis said, the environment remains challenging across the industry.
At that time, I said that for the first half of FY '21, we were anticipating year-over-year growth in licensing revenue from higher adoption of Dolby technologies, but we are also expecting year-over-year decline in products and services revenue because of the COVID impact on the cinema industry.
Today, our scenario is that Q2 revenue could range from $280 million to $310 million.
I already highlighted the revenue range of $280 million to $310 million in total, of which licensing would comprise $270 million to $295 million, while products and services would comprise $10 million to $15 million.
So based on the combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q2 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.36 to $0.51 on a GAAP basis, and from $0.57 to $0.72 on a non-GAAP basis.
