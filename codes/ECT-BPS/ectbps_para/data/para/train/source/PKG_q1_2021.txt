We also expect export prices to move higher.
In the Paper segment, we expect volumes to be fairly flat with higher average prices and mix as we continue the rollout of our recently announced paper price increase.
The second quarter will be our busiest of the year for planned annual outages in the Packaging segment with work scheduled at four of the mills.
