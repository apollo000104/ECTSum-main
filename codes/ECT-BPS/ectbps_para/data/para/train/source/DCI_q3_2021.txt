Given the strong results we experienced and our visibility into the remainder of fiscal year, we expect full year sales will be up 9% to 11% year-over-year versus our prior guidance of 5% to 8% increase.
We also plan to repurchase 1.5% to 2% of our shares outstanding.
The sales momentum we're currently experiencing is likely to carry through to the first half of fiscal 2022.
Capital expenditures are planned to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million.
