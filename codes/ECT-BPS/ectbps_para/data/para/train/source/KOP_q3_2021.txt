On slide 32, our sales forecast for 2021 has been revised to be approximately $1.7 billion compared with $1.67 billion in the prior year to reflect the lower than previously expected PC volumes on our third and fourth quarter.
On slide 33, we are adjusting our 2021 EBITDA projections to now be approximately $220 million, which is at the low end of our previously communicated range.
On slide 34, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now expected to be approximately $4.12, which is comparable to our all-time high 2020 adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of $0.40 per share from our higher estimated effective tax rate.
Our $4.12 estimate for 2021 is lower than our prior estimate range, primarily due to our effective tax rate increasing from prior projections.
