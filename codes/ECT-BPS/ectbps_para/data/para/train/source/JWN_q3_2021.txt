In our top 20 markets where our market strategy continues to gain traction, order pickup accounted for 12% of digital demand, versus 4% in other markets.
For example, the average customer that shops across both banners, in-store and online, spends over 12 times more than a customer utilizing a single channel.
This quarter, we continued to see strength in pandemic-related categories, particularly home and active, where our sales increased 95% and 57% respectively compared to 2019 levels.
Nordstrom banner sales returned to 2019 levels in the third quarter.
We made progress toward our goals, with strong digital growth and improving trends in our Nordstrom banner stores, and remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2021 targets and the commitments we set forth at our investor event, delivering EBIT margins greater than 6% and annual operating cash flow greater than $1 billion.
We expect revenue growth of more than 35% versus fiscal 2020, and we are still projecting slight sequential top-line improvement from Q3 to Q4.
Looking ahead, we anticipate elevated inventory levels through the end of the fiscal year as we position product to meet customer demand and invest in pack-and-hold inventory for the Rack.
In response to macro-related supply chain challenges, we have identified various ways to improve our internal network and processes by diversifying our carrier capacity, gaining better end-to-end visibility of inventory as it moves through our supply chain, increasing velocity and throughput in our distribution and fulfillment centers, and better positioning our inventory to get it closer to the customer.
