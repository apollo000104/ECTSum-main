And I would just note that given the current dynamic market environment, and of course, assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as constant exchange rates, in the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.62.
This would represent sales growth of 14% to 16% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 9% to 13% compared to the third quarter of last year.
