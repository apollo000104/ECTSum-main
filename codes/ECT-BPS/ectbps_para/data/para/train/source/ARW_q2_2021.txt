Finally, I'm happy to report that we increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $600 million.
This comes approximately one year after our last $600 million authorization and shows our continued commitment to returning cash to the shareholders at unmatched levels in our industry.
We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and recently expanded the operation by $600 million.
