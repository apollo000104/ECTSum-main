Consolidated revenues of $62.7 billion increased 13% to the prior year, driven by growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from retail national account customers and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, which is partially offset by branded to generic conversions.
First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.56, an increase of 101% compared to the prior year.
Our commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was recently highlighted by our Board's approval of a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share.
