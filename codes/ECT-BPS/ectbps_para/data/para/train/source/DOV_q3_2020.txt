As a result of our performance in the first three quarters of the year and a solid order backlog, we are raising our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.40 to $5.45 per share.
In summation, we're raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.40 per share to $5.45 per share for the full year, above the top end range of our prior guidance.
With strong margin performance to date, we intend to deliver approximately flat year-over-year adjusted margin this year, despite a lower revenue base.
Fueling Solutions remain constructive finishing the year and into 2021.
