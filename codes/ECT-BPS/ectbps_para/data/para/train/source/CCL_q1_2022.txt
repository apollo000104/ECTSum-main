We ended the first quarter 2022 with $7.2 billion in liquidity versus $9.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Revenue per passenger day for the first quarter 2022 increased approximately 7.5% compared to a strong 2019 despite our lucrative world cruises and exotic voyages being shelved this year.
As of today, 75% of our fleet capacity has resumed guest cruise operations.
Since the middle of January, we have seen an improving trend in booking volumes for future sailings.
Recent weekly booking volumes have been higher than at any point since the restart of guest cruise operations.
For the first quarter, occupancy was 54% across the ships in service. Despite all that, during the first quarter, we carried over one million guests, which was nearly a 20% increase from the fourth quarter 2021.
And we now expect each brand's full fleet to be back in guest cruise operations for its respective summer season where we historically generate the largest share of our operating income.
Given all these factors combined, we expect monthly adjusted EBITDA to continue to improve and turn consistently positive at the beginning of our summer season.
We continue to expect that occupancy will build throughout 2022 and return to historical levels in 2023.
Our cumulative advanced book position for the first half of 2023 continues to be at the higher end of the historical range, also at higher prices with or without FCCs normalized for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailings.
We anticipate that many of these costs and expenses driving adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD higher will end during 2022 and will not reoccur in 2023.
As a result of all of the above, we expect to see a significant improvement in adjusted cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022 with a low double-digit increase expected for the full year 2022 compared to 2019.
We continue to expect a net loss for the second quarter of 2022 on both a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis.
However, we expect the profit for the third quarter of 2022.
