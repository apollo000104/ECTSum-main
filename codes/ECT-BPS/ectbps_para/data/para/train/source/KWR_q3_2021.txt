In total, they're adding 15 million in revenue and $2 million in EBITDA.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.63 grew 5% compared to the prior year as our solid adjusted EBITDA coupled with over a million of interest savings due to lower borrowing rates and average borrowings were partially offset by a slightly higher tax expense.
Our record net sales of $449.1 million increased 22% from the prior year, driven by 6% organic volumes, 10% from our pricing initiatives, 4% percent from acquisitions and 2% from foreign exchange.
