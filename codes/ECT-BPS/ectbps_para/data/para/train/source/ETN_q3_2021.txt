Supply chain constraints did have an impact on our revenue, but we still posted 8% growth in the quarter.
Revenues were up 9%, including 1% organic and 8% from the acquisition of Tripp Lite.
When you add the two together, they delivered solid organic growth of 8%, built a sizable backlog, which strengthens our outlook for future quarters and they improved margins by 110 basis points.
And lastly, our Q4 guidance includes earnings between $1.68 and $1.78, organic revenue growth between 7% and 9%, and segment margins between 18.8% and 19.2%, an increase of 160 basis points at the midpoint versus prior year.
