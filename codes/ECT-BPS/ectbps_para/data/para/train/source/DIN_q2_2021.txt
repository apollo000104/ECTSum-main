Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021 was $1.94 compared to an adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.87 for the same quarter of 2020.
Turning to our 2021 financial performance guidance.
We now expect G&A to range between $168 million and $178 million.
We achieved revenue of $233.6 million and EBITDA of $71.7 million, which reflects the continued strength of our franchise model and a gradual return to steady state.
Second, higher incentive compensation is expected in the second half which is a variable component of G&A that will fluctuate based on our business performance.
