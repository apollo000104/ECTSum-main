After adjusting for certain after-tax items, such as 103 million non-cash mark-to-market loss on crude oil derivatives and a $49 million non-cash mark-to-market loss on contingent consideration, we reported adjusted net income of $91 million or $0.59 per diluted share.
In the second quarter, we reported a net loss of $63 million or $0.41 per diluted share.
Our third-quarter production guidance range of 162 to 170,000 a barrels of oil equivalent per day includes 4,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day of assumed Gulf of Mexico storm downtime. For the remainder of the year, we plan to drill and complete 4 wells in the fourth quarter, I just mentioned, in our Catarina acreage, all within our planned annual capex of $170 million.
Overall, our ongoing disciplined spending has led us to tighten our capex guidance for the year, now ranging from 685 million to $715 million, with $700 million maintained as the midpoint. Additionally, we are adjusting our full-year production guidance range to 157.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day to 165.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes fourth-quarter impacts of 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day for assumed Gulf of Mexico storm downtime and 7,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day for net planned offshore downtime.
