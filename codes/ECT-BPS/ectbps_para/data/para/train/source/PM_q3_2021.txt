Our business delivered another strong performance in the third quarter of 2021 coming ahead of our expectation to achieve a record high quarterly adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.58.
Our resulting adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.58 represents plus 8.5% organic growth, and plus 11.3% in dollar terms, a very good performance.
This translate into an adjusted diluted earnings per share range of $6.01 to $6.06, including an estimated favorable currency impact of $0.17 at prevailing rates.
In combustibles, further sequential share gains supported total PMI volume growth of 2.1% in Q3 and we continue to expect total cigarette and HTU volume growth for the year.
Turning back now to our quarterly results, Q3 total shipment volumes increased by plus 2.1%, and by plus 1.5% year-to-date.
