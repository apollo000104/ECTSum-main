Comp sales declined 1.4% compared to the prior year period, which translates into a robust 11.3% increase on a two-year stack basis.
For the full year, net sales increased 1.4% to $34.2 billion, which was on the high end of our full year guidance and on top of a robust 21.6% increase in fiscal 2020.
Merchandise inventories were $5.6 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 7% overall and 1.4% on a per store basis.
We also expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which includes the impact of increases in the cost of certain building materials, as well as continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth.
To that end, we expect a comp sales decline of 1% to 2% in Q1 with an earnings per share in the range of approximately $2.25 to $2.35.
Finally, earnings per share for the fourth quarter decreased 1.9% to $2.57, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 10.6% over a two-year period.
Net sales increased 2.8% to $8.7 billion, following a 17.6% increase in Q4 of 2020.
