Last night we reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $1.19, which we consider another solid quarter in the context of the pandemic.
In this quarter, we were able to absorb estimated total COVID-19 related claim costs of $300 million globally and delivered profitable earnings due to the underlying strength in many of our businesses.
Additionally, as we've seen in the US, there's significant level of excess mortality experience in the population in South Africa, over and above reported COVID-19.
