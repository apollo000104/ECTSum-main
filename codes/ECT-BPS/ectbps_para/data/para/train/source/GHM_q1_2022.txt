Revenue in the quarter was $20.2 million, $16.7 million was organic and $3.5 million was due to the acquisition of Barber-Nichols that closed June 1.
As I discuss that first quarter, I would like you to keep in mind that our full year guidance is unchanged.
Defense revenue was 35% of total revenue in the quarter.
And now, 25 years later, we won back the installation and replaced the original supplier with our own vacuum systems.
