Based on the underlying business performance, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.90 to a $1.
For the quarter, we generated record adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 and segment EBIT of $140 million.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $147 million, and our liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.5 billion.
January volumes were strong and we anticipate the underlying demands in our key end markets will remain robust during the quarter driving year-over-year EBIT growth across all segments.
Looking sequentially, we expect EBIT will moderate somewhat from the first quarter as raw material costs increase and specialty carbons and compounds product lines and we expect higher costs associated with the draw-down of inventory levels in the quarter.
