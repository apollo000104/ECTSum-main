Based on strong Q1 performance and our increased confidence for the balance of the year, we're raising our full-year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $14.75 and $15 per share and organic growth to be in the 6% to 7% range.
For the second quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.61 and $3.65 and expect second quarter organic revenue growth to be in line with the full-year organic growth rate.
Adjusted DEPS was $3.60, 18% above prior year.
Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion, which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter.
