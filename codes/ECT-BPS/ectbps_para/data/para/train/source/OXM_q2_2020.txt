In contrast to our e-commerce business, consumer traffic in bricks and mortar locations was understandably very challenged in the quarter, driving meaningful revenue decreases in our stores and restaurants.
In our third quarter, which is typically our smallest quarter of the year, we're expecting the year-over-year decline in bricks and mortar traffic to be slightly less pronounced than it was in the second quarter.
As a result of the reduced traffic, a smaller flash sale and continued softness at wholesale, we expect year-over-year revenue to decline in the third quarter at a rate similar to that of the second quarter.
