I'll start today with a review of our guest cruise operations along with our third quarter monthly average cash burn rate.
Our booking volumes for the all future cruises during the third quarter 2021 were higher than booking volumes during the first quarter.
Our cumulative advanced book position for the second half of 2022 is ahead of a very strong 2019 and is at a new historical high.
As we previously guided, the ships in service during the third quarter were, in fact, cash flow positive.
Revenue per passenger cruise day for the third quarter 2021 increased compared to a strong 2019 despite the current constraints on itinerary offerings which did not include many of the higher-yielding destination-rich itineraries offered in 2019.
For the third quarter 2021, our cash burn rate was $510 million per month, which was better than our previous guidance and was in line with the $500 million per month for the first half of 2021.
We have also opened bookings earlier for cruises in 2023, and we're achieving those early bookings with strong demand and good prices.
With the timing of certain capital expenditures now shifting to the fourth quarter, the company expects its monthly average cash burn rate for the fourth quarter to be higher than the monthly average rate for the first nine months of the year.

We do anticipate that most of these costs and expenses will end with 2022 and will not reoccur in fiscal 2023.
We're evaluating the remaining shifts through next spring, with a continued focus on maximizing future cash flow while delivering a great guest experience in a way that serves the best interest of public health.
