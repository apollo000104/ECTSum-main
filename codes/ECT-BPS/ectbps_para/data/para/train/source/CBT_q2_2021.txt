Based on these factors, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.95.
For the quarter, we generated a second consecutive record adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 and segment EBIT of $149 million.
Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect overall volumes to remain strong.
In addition, we anticipate higher feedstock cost flow-through in Asia, while fixed costs are expected to be higher due to the timing of planned plant maintenance spending, after delayed spending in 2020 and the first half of this fiscal year.
Against this demand outlook, we expect some impact from the flow-through of higher raw material costs in Asia, moderating volumes into automotive applications due to the semiconductor chip shortage and higher fixed costs as we perform some maintenance and turnarounds that are necessary to ensure we can meet customer demand in 2022.
In addition, we anticipate higher fixed costs in the second half of the fiscal year due to the timing of spending.
