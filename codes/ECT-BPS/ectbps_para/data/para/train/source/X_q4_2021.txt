Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $3.64 per share and was significantly impacted by a noncash year-end true-up to our tax valuation allowance.
So we will continue to buy back our own stock and are pleased to announce an incremental $500 million authorization.
As mentioned earlier, I am pleased to say that our Board has authorized a new and incremental repurchase program of $500 million.
It puts us on a path for another strong year in 2022.
