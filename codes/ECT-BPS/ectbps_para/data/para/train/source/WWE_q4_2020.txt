Additionally, we anticipate a significant year-over-year increase in expense due to continued higher TV production expenses at WWE's ThunderDome as well as the return of employees from furlough.
We estimate that WWE can achieve 2021 adjusted OIBDA of $270 million to $305 million as revenue growth driven by the Peacock transaction, the gradual ramp-up of ticketed live events, including large-scale international events, and the escalation of core content rights fees is offset by the increase in production and personnel expenses.
In our view, the stated 2021 adjusted OIBDA guidance range will be approximately 15% to 20% higher without the ongoing impact of COVID-19, which includes the loss of ticket and merchandise sales of live events and the increased investment in production to further fan engagement.
Given increasing visibility regarding WWE's projected performance and liquidity, we are planning to restart this project in the second half of '21.
And as such, we are not reinstating more specific quarterly guidance at this time.
The timing and rate of returning ticketed audiences to WWE's Live Events remains subject to significant uncertainty.
Certainly, the contractual escalation of WWE's core content rights fees will continue to be an important source of growth.
As of December 31, 2020, WWE held $593 million in cash and short-term investments.
