Earlier today, we reported fourth-quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion, and earnings per diluted share of $3.49.
For the full year, revenue of $7.2 billion is up $216 million, a 3.1% increase after a 12.3% growth in 2019 despite a revenue decline at ELS, driven by COVID shutdowns in Spain earlier in 2020. In particular, this reduces our corporate operating earnings, which we expect to be a negative $85 million in 2021, and increases our other income, which is below the line, which we expect to be approximately $90 million in 2021.
