For the quarter, we reported net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes of $2.73, up 5% from the prior year period.
For all of 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits compared to 2020.
These results support our full year outlook of 10% to 14% growth in net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes, marking our fifth consecutive year of strong profitable growth.
