Consolidated net sales in the quarter of $1.4 billion were up significantly compared to $759 million in Q3 of last year.
For Q3, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share versus $1.27 in the prior-year quarter.
Excluding a small restructuring and impairment charge, we generated $1.13 in the quarter versus $1.36 in the prior year, after adjusting for restructuring and a small gain on our investment in Nikola.
And market demand is good, and the war in Ukraine, and its impacts on the steel supply chain pricing, and end-market demand are difficult to predict.
Our teams executed very well in the quarter, and the result was a strong financial performance.
