As previously communicated, my expectation for full year 2021 was operating cash flow in excess of $300 million.
With our upward revision in 2021 revenue expectations, I am still targeting the same level of operating cash flow performance, but it is possible that we may not eclipse the $300 million target should our working capital investment be greater than expected during the fourth quarter.
Our board of directors just authorized a new and our largest share repurchase authorization of an additional $300 million.
