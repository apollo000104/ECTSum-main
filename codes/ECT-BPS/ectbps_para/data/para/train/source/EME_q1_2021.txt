We earned $1.54 per diluted share versus $1.35 in the year-ago period on revenues of $2.3 billion with operating income margins of 5.1%.
Diluted earnings per common share in the first quarter is $1.54 as compared to $1.35 per diluted share for the prior year period.
And we're going to take the top end of the range up about a $0.05 or $6.75 per diluted share. And so with that, we're going to raise the low end of our guidance range to $6.35".
And we expected to do that on $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion in revenue.
