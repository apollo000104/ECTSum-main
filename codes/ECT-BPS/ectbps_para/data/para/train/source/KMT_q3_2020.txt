Sales declined 19% year-over-year or negative 17% on an organic basis to $483 million.
Reported earnings per share was $0.03 versus $0.82 in the prior period.
The decline in Asia Pacific was partially affected by the lower demand associated with the early onset of COVID-19 in China and continued lower end market demand in India.
And our Bangalore, India plant, which was closed on March 26, is reopening this week.
Should demand trends deteriorate more significantly than we currently anticipate, we know our dividend program, like other cash flow and cost control actions, is a lever that could be used to preserve cash and liquidity.
This was achieved by early and aggressive cost control actions, such as furloughs in the U.S. and similar actions around the world, reduced discretionary spending and extensive travel restrictions.
Furthermore, we are approaching the end of the incremental capex for the program, significantly lowering the overall capital spend in FY 2021.
Overall, I remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet even in the face of the current macro uncertainty.
