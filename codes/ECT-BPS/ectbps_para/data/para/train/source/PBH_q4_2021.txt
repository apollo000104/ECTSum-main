EPS for the third quarter was $0.79 per share, down $0.03 versus the prior year as lower interest expense from debt pay down and lower share count only partially offset the decline in revenues versus year ago.
Q4 revenue of $237.8 million declined 5.4% and 6.6% on an organic basis versus the prior year, which excludes the effects of foreign currency.
For the full year fiscal '22, we anticipate revenues of approximately $957 million to $962 million, including organic revenue growth of 1.5% to 2%. We anticipate earnings per share of $3.58 or more for fiscal '22.
