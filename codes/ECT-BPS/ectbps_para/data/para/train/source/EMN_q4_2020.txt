When we put this together, we expect our '21 adjusted earnings per share will increase between 20% and 30% compared to 2020.
This will not only reduce the company's use of fossil fuels feedstocks, but it will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 30%.
We shifted our financial forecast for prioritizing cash and liquidity given the uncertainties and we delivered another year of outstanding cash flow, our fourth consecutive year of cash flow greater than $1 billion.
In addition, in our 2020 Sustainability Report, we committed to the ambitious goals of reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by one-third by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Finally, on cash, a high priority for Eastman, we expect '21 to be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow above $1 billion.
