As you can see on Slide 33, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 was heavily impacted by the input cost inflation across our portfolio.
We expect the incremental sales and pricing actions in the second half to offset the dollar impact of the incremental net inflation and other supply chain costs.
We're increasing our organic net sales guidance based on stronger-than-expected consumer demand and lower-than-anticipated elasticities.
We're increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 3%, up from approximately 1%.
