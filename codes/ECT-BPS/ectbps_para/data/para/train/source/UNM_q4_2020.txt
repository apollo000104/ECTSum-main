So excluding these items, after tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $235.3 million or $1.15 per diluted common share compared to $290.7 million or $1.41 per diluted common share in a year ago quarter.
Before I do so, I want to level set our reported adjusted operating income of $1.15 per share for the fourth quarter against the outlook we provided at our December 17, outlook meeting, which did call for adjusted operating earnings per share within a range of $1.14 to $1.24.
As Tom outlined in his opening after tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $235.3 million or $1.15 per common share.
This in turn is expected to drive a strong rebound in our results, likely in the second half of 2021, and cause us to expect to get back to our historic levels of growth and profitability in 2022.
