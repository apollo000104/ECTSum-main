Accordingly, we are raising our earnings per share guidance to the range of $5.50 to $5.65 for 2021 from $4 to $4.20 that we guided to after the December quarter.
For the quarter, revenue grew 70% to over $523 million due largely to same-store sales growth of 45%.
The record sales and earnings growth we delivered were driven by robust 45% same-store sales growth, which is on top of 1% same-store sales growth a year ago.
In the quarter, the margin expansion and generally good expense control led to operating leverage of 21% and the record earnings and earnings per share of $1.69.
Our record March quarter saw both net income and earnings per share rise more than seven-fold, generating $1.69 in earnings per share versus $0.23 a year ago.
