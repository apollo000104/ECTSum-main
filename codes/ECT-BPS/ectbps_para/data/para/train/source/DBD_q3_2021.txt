We are revising our revenue range to $3.9 million to $3.95 billion, which reflects approximately $140 million in revenue deferral from 2021 to 2022 due to the current supply chain challenges.
Accordingly, we are revising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $40 million to a range of $415 million to $435 million taking into account the gross margin associated with the aforementioned revenue deferral and an incremental $20 million for supply chain related inflation over previous estimates.
