As Javier mentioned, our fourth-quarter results were slightly above the midpoint of our revised guidance.
We have repurchased to date an additional 1.4 million shares in 2022.
Now looking ahead to 2022, our adjusted OI guidance is a range of $1.525 billion to $1.675 billion, and our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $7.50 to $8.50 per share.
Finally, we expect free cash flow of $850 million to $1.1 billion in 2022. As Javier said, the incremental mortality due to COVID in the fourth quarter was approximately 1,100, compared to approximately 1,600 in Q3.
