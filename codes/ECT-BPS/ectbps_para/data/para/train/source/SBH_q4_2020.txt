Given all of this, we are not able to provide detailed financial guidance for fiscal 2021.
Now, let's turn to our thoughts on the current economic environment and our outlook for next year.
Our Sally Beauty retail business in the U.S. and Canada delivered same-store sales growth of 3.7% for the quarter. All in, we delivered enterprise positive same-store sales of 1.3% with strength in retail, helping to compensate for soft, but still positive same-store sales in the wholesale business.
During the fourth quarter, the company used a portion of its cash to reduce its debt levels by $445 million, including paying off its outstanding balance on its revolving line of credit by $375 million, the entire FILO loan balance of $20 million and $50 million of the fixed portion of its Term Loan B. The company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter.
Following our fast launch of Ship-From-Store and Same-Day Delivery in Q3, we launched 'Buy Online / Pickup In-Store' at Sally Beauty and it will reach all U.S. stores nationwide within a few weeks.
We will also replatform the BSG digital experience focused firmly on the pro and add further fulfillment options for BSG in the second half of fiscal year 2021.
