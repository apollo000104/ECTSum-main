For the fourth quarter, our reported FFO was $1.37 per share. For modeling purposes, we suggest you consider adding the following to the Q1 annualized FFO of $6.20 per share: $0.19 per share for the impact of lower G&A for the rest of the year; $0.08 per share from lower interest expense due to the bond redemption; and $0.05 per share of incremental FFO from new developments coming online, including 159 East 53rd Street, which is 96% leased to NYU and where we expect to commence revenue in the second quarter; 100 Causeway Street in Boston, which is 94% leased with projected revenue phasing in starting in the third quarter; and 200 West Street, our life science development in Waltham, which is 100% leased and is projected to deliver in December.
For the fourth quarter, our reported FFO was $1.37 per share.
We have provided first quarter 2021 guidance for FFO of $1.53 to $1.57 per share.
We completed another 1.2 million square feet of leasing during the quarter.
We also continue to execute on new and renewal office lease requirements as evidenced by the 1.2 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and the 3.7 million square feet of leasing in 2020 overall, despite the pandemic-related shutdowns.
