E-commerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year, resulting in a 70% two-year stack.
Inventory increased about 28% overall, including higher cost of goods due to inflation, mix, and higher-than-normal in-transit shipments, reflecting continued efforts to improve in-stock. Our effective tax rate is expected to increase to 25% to 26% due primarily to earnings mix.
They drove comp sales of 5.6%.
Comp sales grew 5.6%, up more than 14% on a two-year stack.
Membership income grew 9.1%, driven by membership count, which reached another record high during the quarter.
Given the timing of stimulus overlaps, we expect about a 1% to 2% comp sales increase from Walmart U.S. in the first quarter, followed by somewhat higher comp sales growth throughout the remainder of the year.
Transactions were up more than 3% despite COVID pressures.
International adjusted operating income in constant currency increased nearly 3%, reflecting lower COVID costs, partly offset by gross margin rate decrease related to higher sales penetration from Sam's China and e-commerce.
We expect total company sales to increase about 4% with Walmart U.S. comp sales slightly above 3% for the year.
Due to that and continued investment in strategic priorities, we anticipate this year's capex being at the upper end of the guidance we gave last year of 2.5% to 3% of sales.
Because of how the fly wheel is coming together, I feel great about our ability to deliver against the growth algorithm we discussed last year of about 4% top-line growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales.
We expect total company sales to increase about 4% with Walmart U.S. comp sales slightly above 3% for the year.
