The company had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter of $28.8 million or $1.55 per share, that included a $43.9 million or $2.35 per share non-cash after tax charge, which resulted from terminating a pension plan in the fourth quarter.
Q4 adjusted earnings per share was $1.14, which was near the high-end of our guidance range.
On an adjusted basis, the company delivered earnings per share of $1.14 per fully diluted share within our guidance range of $1 to $1.15.

These uncertainties include economic conditions, market demands and competitive factors.
We guide a GAAP Q1 earnings in the range of $0.50 to $0.70 per fully diluted share.
On an adjusted basis we guide fully diluted earnings in the range of $0.75 to $0.95 per share for the first quarter.
Therefore, revenues for Q1 are estimated to be in the range of $185 million to $200 million.
Lastly, we expect to spend $40 million to $45 million on capital expenditures in 2020.
This growth was partially offset by weakness in general industrial and traditional automotive markets.
A slowdown in demand for products serving the Wireless Infrastructure market for both 4G and 5G applications and seasonal weakness in the portable electronics market were the primary drivers of the lower revenues in Q4.
With the business environment remaining challenging and near term uncertainty related to the impact of the coronavirus, we see the timing of attaining these financial targets as being extended beyond this year.
As a result, we believe the coronavirus will reduce our revenues in the first quarter by approximately 7% to 10%.
