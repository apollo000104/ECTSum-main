As John mentioned, we are expecting to achieve higher pricing in light of higher demand in tight, ready-to-work, super-spec supply.

Today we have 141 active FlexRigs.
As mentioned, our US land rig count stands at 141 rigs today, up from 127 at September 30, our fiscal year-end.
As of today's call, we have 141 rigs contracted, and we expect to end our first fiscal quarter with between 152 and 157 working rigs with current line of sight for a few additional rigs turning to the right in early January.
