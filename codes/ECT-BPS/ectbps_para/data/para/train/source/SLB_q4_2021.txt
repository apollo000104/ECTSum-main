Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.41.
Pretax operating margins improved 31 basis points sequentially to 15.8% and have increased for six quarters in a row.
All divisions posted sequential growth, led by digital and integration.
From a geographical perspective, International revenue grew 5%, while North America grew 13%.
In essence, 2022 will be a period of stronger short-cycle activity resurgence driven by improved visibility in the demand recovery and greater confidence in the oil price environment.
And as oil demand exceeds prepandemic levels in 2023 and beyond, long cycle development will augment capital spending growth in response to the current supply.
In this scenario, increased activity and pricing will drive simultaneous double-digit growth both internationally and in North America that will lead our overall 2022 revenue growth to reach mid-teens.
