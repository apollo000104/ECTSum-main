We reported funds from operations or FFO of $17.5 million or $0.16 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 and $79.4 million or $0.74 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Accordingly, we have introduced full-year 2021 disposition guidance in the range of approximately $350 million to $450 million in aggregate gross proceeds.
The third will be to build upon our December 23 sale of Emperor Boulevard with additional but select dispositions, estimated to be in the range of $350 million to $450 million for full-year 2021 and then to utilize such proceeds primarily for the repayment of debt in order to gain greater financial flexibility and to position FSP for stronger shareholder returns.
Proceeds from potential dispositions under review are currently estimated to be in the range of $350 million to $450 million for full-year 2021, which again would be intended primarily to be used for the repayment of debt.
