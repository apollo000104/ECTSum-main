Sales increased 43% and organic sales increased 32%. The company achieved record fourth quarter and full year sales of $3.5 billion and $11.4 billion respectively.
From a bottom line perspective, fourth quarter earnings were a record $0.51 per share, a 19% increase compared to 2020, an acceleration in our top line results and the addition of the Planters business led to the earnings growth.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.51 was a record.
We anticipate growth from all four segments, driven by continued elevated demand for our products, the impact from our pricing actions, improve production throughput, new capacity for key categories such as pizza toppings and dry sausage, and the full-year contribution of the Planters business.
As a result, we will close the Benson Avenue plant located in Willmar, Minnesota in the first half of fiscal 2022.
The contract will be effective at the start of calendar year 2022.
Finally, we made additional progress on optimizing our pork supply chain by signing a new five-year raw material supply agreement with our supplier in Fremont, Nebraska.
Looking at fiscal 2022, we expect net sales to be between $11.7 billion and $12.5 billion, and for diluted earnings per share to be between a $1.87 and $2.03 per share.
Taking all of these factors into account, as Jim has mentioned, we are setting our full year sales guidance at $11.7 billion to $12.5 billion and our diluted earnings per share guidance at $1.87 to $2.03.

This new agreement more closely matches our pork supply with the needs of our value-added businesses, while simultaneously reducing the amount of commodity pork lease out.
This agreement should result in a reduction of approximately $350 million of commodity fresh pork sales at very low margin.
