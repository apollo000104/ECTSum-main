Today, we reported $7 billion in after-tax net income or $0.82 per diluted share.
As Brian noted, we produced $7 billion in net income, which grew 28% from fourth quarter '20, while earnings per share of $0.82 improved at a faster 39% pace due to our share repurchases.
Provision was a $489 million net benefit in Q4, driven primarily by asset quality, and macroeconomic improvement, and was partially offset by loans growth.
On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $11.4 billion. So focusing on the change on an FTE basis, net interest income increased $1.2 billion from Q4 '20 or 11%, driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity.
Another economic signpost worth noting with our customer activity was acceleration of loan growth in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, the effective tax rate was 6%. Our Q4 expenses were $14.7 billion, an increase of $291 million from Q3.
Given our deposit growth, our supplemental leverage ratio declined to 5.5% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth.
In global banking, we had record years of investment banking fees combined with strong GTS results.
During the quarter, the balance sheet grew $85 billion to a little less than $3.2 trillion, and this reflected the $100 billion of growth in deposits.
Premium amortization declined roughly $100 million to $1.3 billion in Q4, and the positive NII impact of lower premium amortization offset lower PPP fees.
They continued a steady decline through the quarters of 2021, with Q4 down $100 million from Q3 and down more than $500 million from Q4 last year.
In global banking, we had record years of investment banking fees combined with strong GTS results.
The asset quality of our customers remains very healthy and net charge-offs this quarter fell to a historical low of $362 million or 15 basis points of average loans.
