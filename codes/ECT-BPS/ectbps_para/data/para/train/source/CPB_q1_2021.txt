Our strong top-line growth combined with gross margin expansion and value capture synergies, despite the impact of ongoing COVID-19 related costs, led to better than expected adjusted EBIT growth, up 18%, and a 31% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $1.02 per share.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 31%, or $0.24, to $1.02 per share, reflecting an increase in adjusted EBIT as well as a lower net interest expense.
Adjusted earnings per share increased $0.24 from $0.78 in the prior-year quarter to $1.02 per share.
The impact from the adjusted tax rate was nominal, completing the bridge to $1.02 per share.
Organic sales in the first quarter increased 8%, led by 12% organic sales growth in Meals & Beverages reflecting our continued investment in our brands to attract and retain new households as retailers also rebuilt inventory levels.
Organic net sales increased 8% in the quarter, which excludes the impact of the sale of the European chips business.
Breaking down our net sales performance for the quarter, organic net sales increased 8% from the prior year.
We expect year-over-year growth in net sales of 5% to 7% as growth more closely aligns with consumption reflecting better inventory, strong programming and improving share positions.
We expect the combination of healthy EBIT growth and the benefit of significantly reduced interest expense year-over-year to result in adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 15%, or $0.81 to $0.83 per share.
We expect an additional $60 million to $70million in the balance of fiscal 2021 and we remain on-track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.
