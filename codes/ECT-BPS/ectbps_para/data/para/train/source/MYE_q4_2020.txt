Net sales are expected to increase by mid to high 20%, including an incremental 10.5 month of sales related to the Elkhart acquisition and the expected impact of the March 1st price increase.
Taking all of these assumptions into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.05 per share.
Other key assumptions impacting EBITDA and cash flow include depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $23 million in capex of approximately $15 million.
