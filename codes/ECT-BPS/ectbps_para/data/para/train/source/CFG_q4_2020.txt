We announced a $750 million share purchase authorization today and we will commence activity during the quarter.
Given positive credit trends in capital strength, our Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $750 million of common stock beginning in first quarter of 2021.
Q4 credit provision was $124 million versus $110 million a year ago on a pre-CECL basis as the normalization of provision to more front book origination levels helped drive our strong returns.
