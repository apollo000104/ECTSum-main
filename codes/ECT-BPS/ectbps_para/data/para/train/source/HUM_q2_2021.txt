Well, we are maintaining our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of approximately $21.25 to $21.75 at the midpoint, representing full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 16% above the 2020 baseline of $18.50 in excess of our long-term growth target, while acknowledging the continued uncertainty driven by COVID-19 hospitalization trends and the rate at which non-COVID cost normalized.
And accordingly, today we are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $21.25 to $21.75, while acknowledging the continued uncertainty as it respects to COVID hospitalization trends as well as the pace at which non-COVID costs bounce back and at what level they ultimately normalize.

As Susan will describe in more detail, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance now assumes a $600 million COVID-19-related headwinds that is expected to be largely offset by favorable operating items.
As Bruce indicated, given our experience to date, together with our current estimates for the back half of 2021, we have effectively recognized a $600 million COVID-related headwind for Medicare Advantage in our full year guide, offset by favorable operating items.
