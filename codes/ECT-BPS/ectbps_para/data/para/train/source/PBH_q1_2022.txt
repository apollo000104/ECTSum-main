Meanwhile, our financial profile has remained solid throughout the change in consumer purchasing patterns, and we generated record earnings per share of $1.14 and free cash flow of approximately $68 million in Q1.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was a record $1.14 per share, up over 30% versus the prior year driven by both the higher sales discussed and lower interest expense.
Lastly, record diluted earnings per share of $1.14 grew 32.5% over the prior year.
Q1 revenue of $269.2 million increased 17.3% and 15.6% on an organic basis versus the prior year, the latter excluding the effect of foreign currency.
Looking forward, we now anticipate interest for the full year to approximate $63 million, reflecting the recent financing completed in conjunction with the TheraTears acquisition.
We anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $3.90 or more for fiscal '22.
