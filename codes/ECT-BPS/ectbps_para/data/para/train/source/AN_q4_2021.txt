Today, we reported fourth quarter total revenue of $6.6 billion, an increase of 14% year over year, driven by impressive growth in used vehicles of 55% as well as double-digit growth in both customer financial services and aftersales.

And as a result, used vehicle revenue increased 55% for the quarter. This was partially offset by a 7% decline in new vehicle revenue due to the continuing supply chain disruption to new vehicles production.
I think demand for vehicles continues to be strong.
