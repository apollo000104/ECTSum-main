Despite the challenges we faced, we demonstrated the flexibility inherent in our business model to produce financial results that were within our guidance range in our fiscal third quarter, with revenue of $411 million and non-GAAP net income of $0.92 per share.
Non-GAAP net income was $0.92 per share, which was at the lower end of our guidance range, even after the greater-than-expected effects on both revenue and expenses that Seamus discussed.
Non-GAAP net income was 34.8 million in the third quarter or $0.92 per diluted share, as I indicated earlier.
From an earnings perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.92 and GAAP net income per share of $0.64 to $0.76, based on approximately 27.6 million of fully diluted shares outstanding.
