We delivered strong third quarter results with our sales increasing 17.5% year-over-year to $364.3 million on significantly higher volume.
As Karen highlighted, our consolidated sales were strong, increasing 17.5% to $364.3 million.
The strength in our gross profit margin combined with our efforts in expense management and reduced cost from travel and other restrictions, as a result of the COVID-19 helped drive a 49.8% year-over-year increase in our income from operations to $91.3 million and strong earnings of $1.54 per diluted share.
Accordingly, net income totaled $67.1 million or $1.54 per fully diluted share compared to $43.7 million or $0.97 per fully diluted share.
Our sales were further supported by strong US housing starts in 2020.
