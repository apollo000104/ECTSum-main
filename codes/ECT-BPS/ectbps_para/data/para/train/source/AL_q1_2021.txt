For the first quarter of 2021, we are reporting $475 million in total revenues and diluted earnings per share of $0.70 a share, down 7% and 40%, respectively, compared to the prior year's prepandemic first quarter.
We also delivered our third 737-8 to Cayman Airways in the Caribbean, the national flag carrier of Cayman Islands, which is retiring its last 737-300 aircraft and replacing it with our new 737-8 model, and the first of which, 10 737-8 aircraft that we just delivered to Blue Air in Romania.
However, we anticipate our overall sales in 2021 will not reach prepandemic level.
