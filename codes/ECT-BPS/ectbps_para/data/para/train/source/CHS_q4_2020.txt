Net sales totaled $386.2 million compared to $527.1 million last year.
We ended the year with inventories down over 17% from the prior fiscal year-end. This $65 million represented about 25% of our annual rent expense, which we felt was a reasonable request at the time.
And we navigated the fourth quarter without increasing debt levels on our newly amended credit facility, which matures in October 2025.
This 26.7% decrease reflects a comparable sales decline of 24.9% as well as the impact of 39 net store closures in the year, partially offset by a double-digit growth in digital sales.
