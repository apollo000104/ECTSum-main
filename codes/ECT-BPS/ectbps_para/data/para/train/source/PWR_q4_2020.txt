These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2021 annual revenues of $11.95 billion to $12.35 billion, and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.09 billion and $1.19 billion.
With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $3.16 and $3.66, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.02 and $4.52.
