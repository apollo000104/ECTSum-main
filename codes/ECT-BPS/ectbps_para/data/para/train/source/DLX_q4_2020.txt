All of this means, we expect to achieve full-year 2021 revenue growth of 0% to 2% with full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%.
Our total revenue in the quarter was $454.5 million, a decline of 12.9% as compared to the same period last year; however, an increase of 3% from the third quarter.
We are poised for recovery to begin in the second quarter enabling us to exit the year a sales-driven mid-single-digit revenue growth company.
As Barry mentioned, DLX delivered in 2020; we delivered EBITDA margin in line with our plan and guidance.
