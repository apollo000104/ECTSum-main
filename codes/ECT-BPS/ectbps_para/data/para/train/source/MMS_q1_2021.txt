As a result of these positive developments, we are raising our full year guidance for fiscal 2021.
For the full year, we expect revenue will now range between $3.4 billion and $3.525 billion for fiscal 2021, driven by new work in support of government's ongoing response to COVID.
Additionally, we expect diluted earnings per share will range between $3.55 and $3.75 for fiscal 2021.
Our fiscal 2021 cash from operations are projected to now be between $350 million and $400 million and free cash flow between $310 million and $360 million.
