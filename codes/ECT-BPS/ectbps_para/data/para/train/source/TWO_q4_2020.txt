Core earnings increased to $0.30 per share from $0.28 in Q3.
We are very pleased with our fourth-quarter performance and book value of $7.63, which represents a 5.8% quarterly return on book value.
Results for 2020 as a whole were disappointing to be sure as book value declined to $7.63 from $14.54, a result of the market volatility and dislocation induced by the pandemic.
As Bill mentioned, our book value rose to $7.63 from $7.37 per share on September 30, resulting in a total economic return of 5.8%.
