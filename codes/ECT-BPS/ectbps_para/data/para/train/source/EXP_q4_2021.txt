Revenue for the fourth quarter was up 12% to $343 million, reflecting a very strong end to our fiscal year.
This decision is important one in the context of our capital allocation priorities, which I might add, remain unchanged.
Meanwhile, capital spending declined to $54 million.
Annual operating earnings increased 2% to $193 million, reflecting higher net sales prices, partially offset by higher input prices, namely recycled fiber costs and the impact of starting up the paper mill after the expansion project.
