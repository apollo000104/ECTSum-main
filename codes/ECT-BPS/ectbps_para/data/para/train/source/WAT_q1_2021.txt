In the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $609 million, an increase of approximately 27% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in sales growth of 31% as reported.
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 as the significant prior year COVID cost savings actions start to normalize.
Rolling all this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.85 to $10.05, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings-per-share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.37 compared to $0.86 last year.
These dynamics support updated full-year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth up 8% to 11%.
We expect constant currency sales growth to be 14% to 16%.
