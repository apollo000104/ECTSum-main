Yesterday, we reported record earnings of $0.94 per share compared with $0.54 in the prior year's quarter and $0.79 sequentially.
Total assets under management was a record $96.2 billion at June 30th, an increase of $9.2 billion or 11% from March 31st.
The increase was due to net inflows of $2.6 billion and market appreciation of $7.4 billion, partially offset by distributions of $769 million.
We believe our strong brand and investment performance have put us in a unique position to capitalize on these trends as evidenced by our $2.6 billion in net inflows and the 12% organic growth in this latest quarter.
