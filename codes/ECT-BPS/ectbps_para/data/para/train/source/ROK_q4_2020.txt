As I mentioned earlier, Adjusted earnings per share of $1.87 was better-than-expected, mainly as a result of better organic sales, productivity, and a slightly lower tax rate.
Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range on the new basis is $8.45 to $8.85.
ARR is expected to grow double digits in fiscal '21, after showing over 6% growth in fiscal 20. In Q4, total reported sales declined by 9% versus the prior year.
We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 6.5% and about 5% at the mid-point of our range.
During the fourth quarter, we paid off the $400 million term loan that we executed earlier in the year, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio at September 30 was 1.0.
