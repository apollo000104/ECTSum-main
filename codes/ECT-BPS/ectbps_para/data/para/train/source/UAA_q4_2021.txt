Excluding restructuring charges, income related to our first year of the MyFitnessPal divestiture earnout and the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes, our adjusted net income was $67 million or $0.14 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.
After tax, we realized a net income of $110 million or $0.23 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter.
Versus 2019, revenue is up 8%. Compared to the prior year, revenue was up 9% to $1.5 billion.
From a balance sheet perspective, inventory was down 9% to $811 million, driven by continued improvements in our operating model and inbound shipping delays due to COVID-related supply chain pressures.
Related to gross margin, our fourth quarter improved 130 basis points to 50.7%.
We expect our transition quarter rate to be down approximately 200 basis points against our Q1 2021 adjusted gross margin, which includes approximately 240 basis points of negative impact from higher freight expenses related to ongoing COVID-19 supply chain challenges in addition to an unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by pricing benefits.
So we now expect to recognize total planned charges ranging from $525 million to $550 million.
We expect to recognize any remaining charges related to this plan by the end of the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023.
From a revenue perspective, we now expect our transition period to be up at a mid-single-digit rate compared to the previous expectation of a low single-digit rate increase.
Thus far, we've realized $514 million of pre-tax restructuring and related charges. Related to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $14 million of charges in the fourth quarter.
With that, we expect operating income to reach approximately $30 million to $35 million and diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.02 to $0.03.
We expect to recognize any remaining charges related to this plan by the end of the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023.
At this time, we do expect these uncertainties to cause material impacts and variability in our future results.
