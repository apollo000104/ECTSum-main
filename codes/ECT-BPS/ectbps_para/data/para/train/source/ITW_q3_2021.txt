Revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 6% and earnings per share of $2.02 was up 10%.
GAAP earnings per share of $2.02 was up 10% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.06.
As Scott said, demand remained strong in Q3 with total revenue of $3.6 billion an increase of 8% with organic growth of 6%.
We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion, which is up 13% at the midpoint, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 12%. Operating income growth of 14% and an operating margin of 25% plus in Q3.
And as per usual process, our guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test and Simulation business.
