Revenues increased $52.5 million or 9% between quarters including $49.5 million from Riggs Distler following the August 27 acquisition.
For the third quarter of 2021, we reported a consolidated net loss of $0.19 per share compared to third quarter earnings per share of $0.32 in 2020.
As I previously mentioned current quarter results reflect the impact of a $5 million legal reserve. Centuri our utility infrastructure services segment results for the third quarter were impacted by one-time transaction cost associated with the Riggs Distler acquisition of $13 million.
We're very excited about this planned acquisition which is forecasted to be accretive to earnings in 2022.
As we approach the final quarter of 2021, we have refined our previous guidance to a range of $4 to $4.10.
