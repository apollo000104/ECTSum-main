GIC's 49% equity interest will be a cash contribution totaling approximately $208 million, and our 51% controlling interest will come from a combination of common and preferred op units.
The utilization of common and preferred op units for our 51% equity interest will preserve nearly all of our liquidity of $450 million, leaving us ample runway to pursue additional growth opportunities.
