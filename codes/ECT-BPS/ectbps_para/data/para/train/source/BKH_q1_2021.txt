We delivered earnings per share of $1.54 compared to $1.59 as adjusted in Q1 2020.
We plan on capital investments in more than $3 billion through 2025 and we expect to identify and develop incremental projects.
For the quarter, heating degree days were 4% higher than normal at our electric utilities and 3% higher than normal at our gas utilities, attributable primarily to extreme cold in February, offsetting warmer than normal weather in January and March.
We also reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance and we remain confident in our long-term growth targets, including 5% to 7% earnings growth for 2023 through 2025 and at least 5% annual dividend growth.
