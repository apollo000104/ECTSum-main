Sales grew at a very nice clip at 48% this quarter.
We are now expecting to see our full year adjusted EBITDA coming in above $130 million, which is our highest annual total since 2013.
There are continuing positive signs in our end markets, which puts Titan in a good position, as I stated earlier, to post adjusted 2021 adjusted EBITDA of over $130 million.
On a trailing 12-month basis, our adjusted EBITDA stands at $116 million as of this quarter, and we expect Q4 performance to be strong, improving that run rate to over $130 million for fiscal 2021.
