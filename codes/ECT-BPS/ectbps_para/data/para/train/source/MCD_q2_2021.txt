Adjusted earnings per share in Q2 was $2.37, which excludes a gain on the further sale of some of our ownership in McDonald's Japan and a onetime income tax benefit in the U.K. In year-to-date, adjusted operating margin was 43%, reflecting improved sales performance across all segments and higher other operating income compared to last year.
This includes an advertising rehit of our Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which continues to perform at an elevated level and the success of our BTS meal.
The market benefited from continued growth in delivery and successful marketing and core menu news, including the BTS Famous Orders and 50th Birthday Big Mac promotion.
And finally, foreign currency translation benefited Q2 results by $0.13 per share.
