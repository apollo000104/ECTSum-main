For Q2 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.02 to $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.44.
Based on the strong start to fiscal-year '21, we are raising our fiscal-year '21 non-GAAP earnings per share outlook to $1.70 to $1.88 and free cash flow to $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion.
Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow this quarter and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal-year '21 free cash flow guidance from our SAM guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion to a revised outlook of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint.
For Q2 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.02 to $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.44.
