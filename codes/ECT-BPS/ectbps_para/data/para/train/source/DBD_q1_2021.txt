In the first quarter, we delivered 4% revenue growth underpinned by market share gains in ATMs and self-checkout solutions.
I'll provide additional color about key market trends in just a minute, but I'll simply say that our growth in Q1 gives us the confidence to reiterate our 2021 revenue outlook of $4 billion to $4.1 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million was the highest first quarter in the company's history and while Jeff will discuss the details, I'm especially pleased that our operating profit growth of 25% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% significantly outpaced our top line growth of 4%.
Adjusted for foreign currency and divestitures, revenue increased 2.4% led by product growth of 11%, software growth of 7%, and a services decline of 4%.
We expect to generate revenue of $4 billion to $4.1 billion, which equates to 3% to 5% annual growth.
