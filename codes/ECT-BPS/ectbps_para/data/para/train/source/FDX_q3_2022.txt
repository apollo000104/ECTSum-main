Execution of our strategies resulted in substantially higher operating income for the quarter as Team FedEx delivered yet another outstanding peak season.
We are affirming our full year adjusted earnings per share range at $20.50 to $21.50.
We have lowered our FY '22 capital-spending forecast from $7.2 billion to $7 billion.
For the third quarter, that was primarily due to higher rates for both purchase transportation and wages.
FedEx Freight once again delivered strong results with third quarter operating income nearly tripling year over year, driven by a continued focus on revenue quality.
