To-date, the direct financial impact of the pandemic has primarily shown in significantly reduced keg demand from the on-premise channel and higher labor and safety related cost at our breweries.
In the first half of 2020, we reported COVID-19 pre-tax-related reductions in net revenue and increases in other costs totally $14.1 million, of which $10 million was recorded in the first quarter and $4.1 million was recorded in the second quarter.
Given our trends for the first half and our current view of the remainder of the year, we've adjusted our expectations for higher 2020 full-year earnings, depletions and shipment growth, which is primarily driven by the strong performance of our Truly and Twisted Tea brands.
