This change reflects the impact of the Q2 2021 performance as well as expectations for the remainder of the year.
On the personnel front, we recently issued an 8-K announcing the reorganization of my direct reports, Rich Lindahl, our Chief Financial Officer; Karen Smith, our Chief Medical Officer and Katy Strei, our Chief Human Resources Officer continued to report directly to me.
