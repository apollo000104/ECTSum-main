Earlier today, we announced adjusted earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 third quarter, which excludes a onetime noncash charge totaling $4.58 per share related to our coastal marine business.
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $4.41 per share.
For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, which represents more than a 15% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet.
