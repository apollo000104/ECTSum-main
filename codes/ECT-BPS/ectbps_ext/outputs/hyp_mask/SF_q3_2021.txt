last quarter, we updated our full year year-six revenue guidance to be in a range of $num-one billion to $num-two billion.
revenue in the quarter totaled nearly $num-one billion, an increase of num-two%.
the growth in revenue and lower expense ratios resulted in non-gaap earnings per share of $num-one, which is up num-two% year-on-year, and $num-three year-to-date, which is up num-four%.
for the nine-month period, we generated record revenue of more than $num-one billion, up num-two% over the comparable period in year-five.
through the first nine months, we're not only on pace to surpass our full year record revenue by more than num-one%, but our earnings per share has already eclipsed last year's full year record, as our pre-tax margin is up more than num-two basis points despite the headwinds of a num-txtnterest rate environment.
however, given the nearly $num-one billion increase in our balance sheet since the end of the first quarter, we are revising this forecast to a range of $num-two million to $num-three million, using the same market and deposit beta assumptions.
in our first quarter earnings call, we estimated that we'd generate an incremental $num-one million to $num-two million of pre-tax income as a result of a num-txtasis point increase in rates.
our quarterly net revenue totaled $num-one million, which was up num-two% from the prior year.
in terms of our fourth quarter expectations, we see net interest income in a range of $num-one million to $num-two million and with a similar nim to the third quarter, as we expect lower activity levels in some of the more episodic fee income opportunities to -- growth in our balance sheet.
as we forecasted, compensation as a percentage of net revenue declined sequentially to num-one%.
absent any assumption for additional share repurchases and assuming a stable stock price, we'd expect the fourth quarter fully diluted share count to be num-one million shares.
fixed income trading revenue of $num-one million was down num-two% sequentially, as we saw lower activity levels in agencies, corporates and munis, as overall market activity declined a similar amount.
as expected, trading revenue declined to $num-one million, while year-to-date trading declined num-two%, to $num-three million.
third quarter revenue totaled $num-one million, up num-two% year-on-year, and year-to-date revenue was approximately $num-three billion, an increase of num-four%.
taken together, stifel's quarterly pre-tax income totaled $num-one million, which increased num-two% from the third quarter of year-five.
nine-month revenue increased num-one%, to over $num-two billion.
