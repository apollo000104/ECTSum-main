ncr's stand-alone non-gaap earnings per share was $num-one higher at $num-two.
in the bottom left, non-gaap earnings per share was $num-one, up $num-two or num-three% from the prior-year second quarter.
for eps, we expect a range of $num-one to $num-two, which includes the immediate accretion for cardtronics of more than num-three%.
for revenue, we expect ncr stand-alone of $num-one billion to $num-two billion, representing num-three% to num-four% year-over-year growth.
this includes num-one% growth for ncr stand-alone and an incremental num-two% growth for the num-three days following the close of the cardtronics transaction.
in the second quarter, we delivered num-one% total revenue growth.
consolidated revenue was $num-one billion, up $num-two million or num-three% versus the year-five second quarter, driven by very strong growth in both our retail and hospitality segments and more modest growth in banking.
that accretion will increase to our targeted num-one% to num-two% within the first full year of the combination.
total company revenue then is expected to be $num-one billion to $num-two billion, including intercompany eliminations.
total company adjusted ebitda is then expected to be between $num-one million and $num-two million.
we remain very excited about the transaction as the addition of cardtronics will accelerate our ncr-as-a-service strategy and is expected to be accretive to non-gaap earnings per share for the first full year by num-one% to num-two%.
revenue was up $num-one million or num-two% sequentially.
in the second quarter, software and services represented num-one% of our revenue, which is a modest decrease from the num-two% in the year ago driven by sco and pos hardware revenue this year.
ncr stand-alone recurring revenue growth grew num-one% over second quarter of year-five.
cardtronics operations are expected to generate revenue of about $num-one million, representing approximately num-two% year-over-year growth for them.
we generated $num-one million of free cash flow in the quarter.
