loss per share from continuing operations increased from $num-one to $num-two, while adjusted loss per share from continuing operations increased from $num-three to $num-four.
we delivered $num-one million of revenue, down num-two% or $num-three million.
total operating expenses in the quarter were $num-one million, a decrease of num-two%, primarily driven by lower tax pro compensation as a result of the prior year extension i just discussed.
since taking over this post in year-one, we have now retired nearly num-one of our shares outstanding and have approximately $num-two million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
interest expense was $num-one million, a decrease of num-two% due to lower draws on our line of credit.
in total, these actions have led to an adjusted earnings-per-share growth of num-one%.
on the capital allocation front, which we'll dig into in a minute, we reduced shares outstanding by another num-one% this quarter.
these achievements have translated into adjusted earnings per share growth of num-one%, and that's even after normalizing fiscal year year-six for the tax season extension.
since year-one, we've averaged annual free cash flow of $num-one million, an increase of num-two%.
this decline was entirely due to the estimated $num-one million related to the tax season extension in the first quarter of last year.
then i'll share perspective on the value we have created over the last several years and the levers we have to achieve our long-term revenue growth target of num-one% to num-two%.
in summary, with respect to revenue growth, we have many levers working in tandem to reach our annual num-one% to num-two% growth target.
over the past five years, we've returned nearly $num-one billion to shareholders or approximately num-two% of our total free cash flow.
turning to share repurchases, we bought a total of $num-one million in the quarter, allowing us to retire num-two million shares at an average price of $num-three.
we have had our foot on the gas since announcing block horizons at our investor day last december where we shared our long-term revenue growth target of num-one% to num-two%.
we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the num-one% to num-two% range for the full fiscal year as we realize the benefits of certain discrete items later in fiscal year-seven.
