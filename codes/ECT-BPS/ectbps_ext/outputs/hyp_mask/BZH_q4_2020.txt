finally, these components taken together led to $num-one million of net income from continuing operations or $num-two per share in earnings this quarter.
our asp is expected to be approximately $num-one.
homebuilding revenue decreased num-one% to $num-two million, primarily driven by a num-three% decrease in closings related to the impact of the pandemic on order and construction timing.
we expect gross margin to be up more than num-one basis points, around num-two%.
second, we generated a return on assets above num-one%, up about num-two point from the prior year as we continue to grow ebitda at a faster rate than our assets.
first, we grew our adjusted ebitda by more than num-one% as gross margins expanded to reflect the benefits of product simplification and the price improvements we achieved.
looking at the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, new home orders increased nearly num-one% to num-two, driven by the highest fourth quarter sales pace we've achieved in the last decade.
this led to adjusted ebitda of $num-one million in the quarter, down slightly in dollar terms, but up over num-two basis points as a percentage of revenue to num-three%.
sg&a was relatively flat on an absolute basis but rose as a percentage of total revenue to num-one%, reflecting the decrease in revenue.
our tax expense for the quarter was about $num-one million for an average annual tax rate of num-two%.
total gaap interest expense was down nearly num-one% or $num-two million.
sg&a as a percentage of total revenue should be down about num-one basis points, reflecting the benefit of our continued focus on controlling costs.
orders are expected to be essentially flat despite an approximately num-one% decline in community count.
our gross margin, excluding amortized interest, impairments and abandonments, was num-one%, up approximately num-two basis points.
we expect ebitda to be up more than num-one%.
entering year-six, our liquidity and anticipated profitability are such that we expect to achieve the last leg of our debt retirement objective, which is to get total debt below $num-one billion by the end of year-seven using only a portion of our future profits.
