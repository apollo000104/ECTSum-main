last night, we announced the approval to increase the dividend this quarter to $num-one per share, definitely driven by current and predicted earnings.
for the year, we generated $num-one million in net income, $num-two per share, shy to the $num-three million that we generated in year-four, definitely impacted by the economic effects on the pandemic and the increased provision driven by cecl and the acquisition.
aurelio mentioned we had a strong quarter, $num-one million in the quarter, $num-two a share, which compares with $num-three million last quarter, $num-four a share.
net income for the year was $num-one million or $num-two a share, but it was affected by $num-three million increase in provision, which includes pandemic impact and the fact that we did record the day num-four cecl allowance of $num-five million i mentioned before required for the loans -- the non-pcd loans we obtained under transaction.
our clients' adoption of digital channels continued to improve during year-five, reaching an increase of over num-one% in logins and digital transaction increasing over num-two% for the year.
we have now over num-one% growth in our customer base, reaching num-two customers.
ppnr came in very strong with $num-one million, up from $num-two million in the prior quarter.
and then, capital is again very strong with cetxt-num at above [phonetic] num-one%, after completing the acquisition.
expenses for the quarter were $num-one million, almost $num-two million, which is up from $num-three million; again full quarter effect.
and when we look at the quarter, core deposits were up another $num-one million.
so we have -- we continued to see excess cash, reserve coverage remain at the similar levels of prior quarter, so very strong reserve coverage at num-one%.
our initial estimates are around $num-one million in loans during the first half of year-six on ppp loans.
adjusted pre-tax pre-provision for the year was up num-one% to $num-two million from $num-three million.
and we expect that there will be an additional somewhere between $num-one million and $num-two million happening mostly on the first half of year-six, as we complete integrations, conversions and a number of other things that are ongoing in the integration process.
those expenses again include the $num-one million in merger and restructuring costs for the quarter.
loan origination and renewal for the year reached $num-one billion, and organic core deposit growth, a record growth of $num-two billion.
