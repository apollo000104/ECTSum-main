taken together, we owned $num-one million of net income from continuing operations or $num-two in earnings per share this quarter, up $num-three million versus the prior year.
sg&a as a percentage of total revenue was num-one%, down num-two basis points, even with $num-three million in one-time charges associated with improving our ongoing cost structure.
we generated very strong financial results in the third quarter with increases in both home closings and gross margins leading to nearly num-one% growth in adjusted ebitda.
specifically, we expect gross margins will be up at least num-one basis points to around num-two% and sg&a will be down more than num-three% on an absolute dollar basis.
we also reported our highest third quarter net income in over num-one years.
this margin excludes impairments and abandonments associated with our reunderwriting process totaling $num-one million.
our gross margin, excluding amortized interest, impairments and abandonments, was up approximately num-one basis points to num-two%, driven by increased margins on spec homes and our ongoing efforts to simplify product and reduce incentives.
for the full year of fiscal year-five, we expect adjusted ebitda to be up num-one% to num-two% compared to last year with a big improvement in gross margin more than offsetting the impact of fewer home closings.
even with that, however, our cash interest expense was down $num-one million as a result of our prior debt retirements and refinancing activities.
total gaap interest expense was up around $num-one million, primarily due to our decision to carry a fully drawn revolver through nearly the entire quarter for liquidity purposes.
our tax expense in the quarter was about $num-one million for an average tax rate of num-two%.
after our upcoming september repayment, we will have just over $num-one million remaining on our goal of bringing our total debt below $num-two billion.
accordingly, we expect our backlog conversion ratio will be in the low-num-one% range rather than the high-num-two%s like last year.
specifically, compared to last year, we grew homebuilding revenue by num-one% to $num-two million as we benefited from an num-three% increase in closings combined with a num-four% increase in our asp.
we have no significant maturities until year-ten and our clearly defined deleveraging path includes $num-one million term loan repayments in each of the next three years.
as allan highlighted earlier, adjusted ebitda in the quarter was up nearly num-one% versus the prior year to $num-two million.
