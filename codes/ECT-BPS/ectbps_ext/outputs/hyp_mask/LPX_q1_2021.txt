as a result, lp exceeded $num-one billion in sales, generated $num-two million in ebitda and $num-three million in operating cash flow and earned $num-four per share, all of which are quarterly records.
the $num-one per share of adjusted earnings is num-two times that in the first quarter last year.
smartside net sales grew by nearly num-one% versus qtr-one of last year to $num-two million and ebitda more than doubled to $num-three million.
compared to the first quarter of last year, net sales increased by num-one% to just over $num-two billion, driven by num-three% growth in smartside and over $num-four million of significantly higher osb prices.
i'm therefore, delighted to report that lp's board of directors has authorized a further $num-one billion of share repurchases, which we plan to launch immediately.
we generated $num-one million of operating cash flow, including increased capital investments and heavy spending on logs, common practice for lp in the first quarter.
lp's board also declared a dividend of $num-one per share payable on [date].
the waterfalls on slides num-one and num-two show year-over-year revenue and ebitda growth in the siding and osb segments for the quarter.
we also expect another strong quarter of smartside growth with revenue for the second quarter, at least num-one% higher than last year, which would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of growth above num-two%.
so all said, this would bring full year smartside growth to roughly twice our previous long-term guidance of num-one% to num-two% per year.
the num-one% revenue growth for smartside is the result of num-two% volume growth compounded by num-three% price growth and at $num-four million in sales and $num-five million in ebitda, for an incremental ebitda margin of num-six%.
however, given the acceleration of growth in the second half of last year, we simply cannot increase year-over-year revenue by much more than num-one% in the second half of year-six.
smooth and expertfinish volumes more than doubled, with those innovative products reaching num-one% of total smartside volume.
lp's south american segment also had a very strong quarter, with num-one% more sales and num-two times more ebitda than the first quarter of last year.
we've continued buying back shares through the second quarter and as of the close of business yesterday, had just $num-one million remaining of our existing $num-two million buyback authorization.
the resulting ebitda of $num-one million is more than num-two times last year's result.
