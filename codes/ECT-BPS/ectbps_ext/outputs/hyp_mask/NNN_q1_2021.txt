as jay mentioned today, we increased our year-six core ffo per share guidance from the range of $num-one to $num-two per share to a range of $num-three to $num-four per share.
given our strong start to the year, we're pleased to announce an increase in our guidance for year-six core ffo by approximately num-one% from a range of $num-two to $num-three per share to a range of $num-four to $num-five per share.
that's up $num-one from the preceding fourth quarter $num-two and down $num-three from the prior year's $num-four per share.
today, we also reported that affo per share was $num-one per share for the first quarter, which is $num-two per share higher than the preceding fourth quarter $num-three.
so these two items, totaling approximately $num-one million, added just under $num-two per share to our results.
so improving to num-one% added about $num-two million of revenues in the first quarter versus our prior guidance.
our portfolio of num-one freestanding single-tenant retail properties continued to perform exceedingly well.
results for the first quarter included two nonrecurring type items totaling $num-one million.
as jay mentioned, we reported today rent collections of approximately num-one% for the first quarter, num-two% for april rent collection.
during the quarter, we issued $num-one million of unsecured num-txtear interest-only bonds at a rate of num-two%.
so we ended the first quarter with $num-one million of cash in the bank, a num-two balance on our $num-three million line of credit, no material debt maturities until year-nine and an average debt duration of over num-four years.
for context, full year year-five was $num-one million of lease termination fee income.
notably, we only forgave num-one% of our first quarter rents.
first, we collected $num-one million of receivables from cash basis tenants that relate to prior quarters.
although we continue to be prudent in our underwriting, we acquired num-one new properties in the quarter for just under $num-two million, at an initial cash cap rate of num-three% and with an average lease duration of num-four years.
most notable collections from our cash basis tenants, which represent approximately $num-one million or num-two% of our annual base rent, improved to approximately num-three% for the first quarter.
