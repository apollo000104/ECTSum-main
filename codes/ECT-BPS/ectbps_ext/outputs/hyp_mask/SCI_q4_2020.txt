based on all these assumptions, we also believe adjusted earnings per share in year-six will likely range between $num-one and $num-two per share.
for the full year year-five, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $num-one, a num-two% increase over year-four in a one-of-a-kind year.
and as a result of this surge late in the quarter, we finished the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $num-one compared to $num-two in the prior year, well above the range we provided to you in october.
just to give you a little color on the cadence of the quarter, our same-store funeral volumes were up num-one% in october, then grew to num-two% in november and an unprecedented num-three% in december, which is the highest monthly growth rate we experienced all year.
therefore, we predict an impressive earnings-per-share growth for year-eight approaching $num-one per share, resulting from a combination of enhanced market share and a leaner infrastructure, leveraging technology and a more efficient sales structure.
as i reflect back on the last num-one months, i can say with certainty that our results are a testament to our team's incredible hard work and to the resilience of our underlying business.
total comparable funeral revenues grew approximately $num-one million or num-two% during the quarter.
core revenues grew $num-one million, driven by a num-two% increase in the number of cases, partially offset by a num-three% decline in the funeral sales average.
the preponderance of the growth, $num-one million or about num-two%, was from a num-three% increase in velocity with a number of contracts sold.
recognized preneed revenues accounted for $num-one million of growth, mainly due to higher preneed cemetery sales production during the quarter.
and from an effective tax rate standpoint, we continue to model in the range of num-one% to num-two% in year-six.
the remaining growth of about $num-one million was primarily due to large sales activity.
our expectation for maintenance and cemetery development capital spending in year-six is $num-one million to $num-two million, which is about $num-three million higher than our pre-covid level spend as we proceed with certain projects deferred from last year.
in addition to these recurring capital expenditures of $num-one million at the midpoint, we also expect to deploy $num-two million to $num-three million toward acquisitions and roughly $num-two million to $num-four million in new funeral home construction opportunities, which, together, drive low to mid-teen aftertax internal rates of return, well in excess of our cost of capital.
we generated operating cash flow of $num-one million during the quarter, representing an increase of $num-two million or num-three% over the prior year.
from a profit perspective, funeral gross profit increase of $num-one million, and the gross profit percentage increased num-two basis points to num-three%, realizing a num-four% incremental margin on our revenue growth.
