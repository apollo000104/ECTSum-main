we reported a gaap earnings per share of $num-one versus an earnings per share loss of $num-two in the prior year period.
on an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $num-one per share versus $num-two in the prior year.
adjusted earnings per share of $num-one was essentially flat versus $num-two in the prior year quarter, reflecting the factors i just mentioned.
we expect the underlying organic growth, excluding the effect of fx, to be in this mid-single digits and above our typical sequential growth pattern of num-one% to num-two%.
on a year-over-year basis, organic sales declined num-one% on top of a num-two% decline in the prior year.
in terms of free operating cash flow drivers, as chris and i already mentioned, capital spending for the year is expected to be in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million.
sales this quarter increased sequentially by num-one%, outpacing the num-two% to num-three% increase from qtr-one to qtr-two that we typically see.
effective operations this quarter amounted to negative $num-one.
this compares positively to both the negative $num-one in the prior year quarter and the negative $num-two last quarter.
longer-term, we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low num-one% range as profitability levels increase beyond fiscal year year-six.
we expect the underlying organic growth, excluding the effect of fx, to be in the mid-single digits, which is modestly above our typical sequential growth pattern of num-one% to num-two%.
and we now expect the full year cash restructuring to be higher by $num-one million to $num-two million versus the approximate $num-three million spent in fy year-five.
operating expense as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year to num-one% due to lower sales, however, in dollar terms, decreased num-two%.
total capex is expected to be between $num-one million and $num-two million this year, a num-three% reduction year-over-year.
lastly, for the earnings per share drivers, we have lowered our adjusted effective tax rate expectations for fiscal year year-six to approximately num-one% from our previous estimate of num-two%, which was also the effective tax rate last year.
as a reminder, those two end-markets totaled more than num-one% of our sales.
