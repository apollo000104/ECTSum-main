as a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $num-one to $num-two per share, representing a year-over-year decline of minus num-three% to minus num-four% to the prior year.
adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased num-one% to $num-two per share primarily reflecting the decrease in adjusted ebit.
the earnings per share impact of the num-txtd week in fiscal year-five was estimated to be $num-one per share.
as a result of the third quarter pressures on margin, adjusted earnings per share came in lower than we expected at $num-one.
to put our fiscal year-six earnings per share guidance into perspective at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal year-six to be in line with fiscal year-five considering the impact of the num-txtd week and num-one% above fiscal year-four adjusted eps.
adjusted earnings per share decreased $num-one from $num-two in the prior year quarter to $num-three per share due to the negative $num-one impact of adjusted ebit as slightly lower interest expense was offset by slightly higher adjusted taxes.
to put our fiscal year-six organic net sales guidance into perspective at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal year-six to be num-one% above fiscal year-four.
we expect net sales for fiscal year-six to decline num-one% to num-two%.
during the quarter, organic net sales declined num-one% and adjusted ebit decreased num-two% driven by lower sales volume and a lower adjusted gross margin partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses.
we delivered sales of $num-one billion, in line with our expectations as we cycled a num-two% organic growth comparison to a year ago.
we expect adjusted ebit of minus num-one% to minus num-two%.
adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased num-one% to $num-two per share primarily reflecting lower adjusted net interest expense.
compared to the third quarter of fiscal year-four, we delivered strong consumption growth of num-one% against organic net sales growth of num-two% with the gap driven by our foodservice business, which continued to recover as governments gradually eased on-site dining restrictions in some markets.
we expect net interest expense of $num-one [phonetic] million to $num-two [phonetic] million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately num-three%.
excluding the impact from the num-txtd week in fiscal year-five and the impact of the european chips and plum divestitures, we expect organic net sales to decline num-one% to minus num-two%.
our net sales decline of num-one% and in-market performance of minus num-two% in the third quarter reflect lapping the historically high consumption levels that we experienced during the onset of the pandemic last year.
