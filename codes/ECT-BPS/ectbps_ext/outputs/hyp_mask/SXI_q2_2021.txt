adjusted earnings per share was a $num-one in the second quarter of year-six compared to $num-two a year ago.
revenue decreased just under num-one% year-over-year to approximately $num-two million and operating income was $num-three million or a num-four% year-over-year decrease.
scientific revenue continued to grow at a double-digit rate with a num-one% year-on-year increase driven by strong demand for covid vaccine storage.
organic revenue declined num-one% year-on-year, much of it due to the impact of the pandemic.
in the second quarter electronics segment revenue increased approximately $num-one million or num-two% year-on-year to $num-three million, supported by organic revenue growth of approximately num-four%.
on a year-over-year basis, specialty solutions revenue decreased approximately num-one% to $num-two million and operating income of $num-three million or a num-four% year-on-year decrease.
finally, we continue to expect fiscal year-six capital expenditures to be between approximately $num-one million to $num-two million.
on a year-over-year basis, engineering technologies revenue and operating income decreased approximately num-one% and num-two% to $num-three million and $num-four million respectively.
we now believe that covid related storage demand is likely to be at the higher end of our previously indicated $num-one million to $num-two million range in fiscal year-six.
at electronics nearly half of the num-one% year-on-year revenue increase reflected organic growth with positive trends in electric vehicles, general automotive, appliances and semiconductor equipment.
on a consolidated basis, total revenue increased num-one% year-on-year and num-two% sequentially.
this assumes a tax rate in the mid num-one% range in the third quarter and a tax rate in the low num-one% range in the fourth quarter of year-six.
finally, our previously announced interest expense and tax rate initiatives resulted in an approximate num-one% reduction in interest expense and num-two basis point reduction in tax rate year-on-year in the second quarter fiscal year-six.
we expect covid vaccine storage demand to come in at the high end of our previously indicated $num-one million to $num-two million sales range in fiscal year-six.
scientific segment revenue increased num-one% year-on-year to $num-two million largely due to positive trends at retail pharmaceutical chains and medical distribution companies, much of it associated with the demand for covid vaccine storage.
for fiscal year-six we continue to expect approximately num-one% tax rate.
