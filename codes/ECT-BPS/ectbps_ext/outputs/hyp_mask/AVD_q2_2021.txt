with regard to our sales performance for the second quarter of year-six, the company's net sales increased by num-one% to $num-two million as compared to net sales of $num-three million this time last year.
we said gross profit margins, we are forecasting to be similar to recent years, and at the half, we're right at the same num-one%.
operating expenses, some increases driven by our growth initiatives, and as a percent of sales, up -- for net as a percent of sales, we're down num-one%.
we are reporting $num-one million in net income as compared to $num-two million last year, a quarter-over-quarter increase of num-three%.
within that overall improvement, our us sales increased by num-one% to $num-two million and our international sales increased by num-three% to $num-four million.
operating expenses for the quarter increased by $num-one million or num-two% as compared to the same period of the prior year.
so, with regards to revenue, we said that we would be in low double-digit increase, and at the half now, we're looking at a num-one% increase in our revenue.
we are at that num-one times level, but in the second half, we expect to move that down and, short [phonetic] of acquisition, we'd probably expect to maybe even be below that num-two number.
our tax rate, we expect for the year to end up at the mid num-one%s range, we're actually up num-two% versus num-three%, but we are still thinking we will wind up as we have some tax benefits that we'll see coming for us in fourth quarter.
for those of you that focus on ebitda, we're now saying that our ebitda for the year will wind up growing at a faster rate than revenue as well, and for the half, we've got a num-one% increase.
if, for a moment, we exclude the impact of products and entities acquired since december of year-four, our base inventory has reduced by num-one% from $num-two million at that time to $num-three million this year.
our consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters to [date], year-six, was $num-one million as compared to $num-two million for the four quarters to [date], year-five.
with regard to our qtr-two year-six international sales, we saw increased sales of num-one% and a strong increase in gross margin, which were up num-two%.
so, it's a huge increase when [phonetic] accounted that generally a freighter coming across has about $num-one million of revenue that now has moved up to $num-two million of revenue, so quite a big increase.
for the first half of year-six, we increased sales by num-one%; gross margins by num-two%; and operating expenses have reduced when compared to net sales; our interest expense is down; and net income has improved by num-three%.
our current inventory target at the end of the financial year is $num-one million.
