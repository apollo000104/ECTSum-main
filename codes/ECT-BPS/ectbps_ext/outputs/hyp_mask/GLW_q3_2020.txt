this resulted in net income of $num-one million and earnings per share of $num-two, up num-three% sequentially.
sales were $num-one billion, up num-two% sequentially.
eps grew num-one% sequentially to $num-two, as higher sales and strong manufacturing execution resulted in operating margin expanding to num-three%, up num-four basis points sequentially and num-five basis points year-over-year.
now, looking at the third quarter, we grew num-one% -- sales grew num-one% sequentially to $num-two billion, and our operating margin expanded by num-three basis points sequentially, to num-four%.
in display technologies, third quarter sales were $num-one million, up num-two% sequentially, and net income was $num-three million, up num-four% sequentially.
in the third quarter, we recognized $num-one million of sales from the newly consolidated hemlock.
and hemlock will add approximately $num-one million in annual cash flow.

we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $num-one billion and expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce cost, control inventory and execute well overall.
we are clearly seeing the benefits of this lever in today's results as innovation adoption drove specialty materials sales up num-one% year-over-year despite a declining smartphone market.
