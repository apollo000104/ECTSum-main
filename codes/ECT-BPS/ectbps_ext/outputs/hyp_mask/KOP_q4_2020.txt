for the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $num-one and $num-two per share, which again would represent a new high for koppers beating our previous high of $num-three per share back in year-two.
year-five's expected result would represent an approximate num-one% increase over year-four adjusted earnings per share of $num-two.
our consolidated sales for the year at $num-one billion represents a new high in the fourth consecutive year of growth when we exclude kjcc from prior results.
on slide-num, consolidated sales were $num-one million, an increase of $num-two million from sales of $num-three million in the prior-year quarter.
it will also be the fifth straight year with adjusted ebitda margins between num-one% and num-two% after seven straight years with margins hovering between num-three% and num-four%, just another indication of how we have truly transformed our business model.
throughout year-five, we saw a num-one% increase in leading activities and a corresponding num-two% decrease in recordable cases, which is quite significant.
now, while not yet final, we do expect to finish the year with a new high for operating profit of approximately $num-one million, which would represent a num-two% increase from year-four.
now this compares to $num-one million earned in year-four and exceeds both our recent guidance range of $num-two million to $num-three million and even more incredibly exceeds our original pre-pandemic guidance for the year of $num-four million to $num-three million of ebitda.
sales for rups were $num-one million, flat as compared to the prior-year quarter.
that level of ebitda equates to a margin of num-one% to num-two%, which will be our highest margin since year-two.
pc sales rose to $num-one million from $num-two million, and cm&c sales came in at $num-three million, down from $num-four million.
year-five will also represent a new-high watermark for adjusted ebitda excluding kjcc as we expect to finish between $num-one million and $num-two million.
due to all the hard work and dedication of our global workforce, we are on track to achieve a new high of profitability post kjcc to surpass the high-end of our initial year-five earnings target, to exceed our original net-debt reduction objective of $num-one million, and to reduce our net leverage to num-two, below our pre-pandemic year-five goal of num-three to num-four.
as of [date], year-five, total debt was at $num-one million.
on slide-num, adjusted ebitda for rups was $num-one million, which was the same as the prior year.
