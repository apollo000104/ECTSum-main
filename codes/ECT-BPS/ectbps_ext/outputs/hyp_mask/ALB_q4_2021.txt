we expect net sales of between $num-one billion to $num-two billion and adjusted ebitda in the range of $num-three billion to $num-four billion.
fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-one was down num-two% from the prior year.
for the year, excluding our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in june of year-six, we increased net sales by num-one% to $num-two billion, which was in line with our previous guidance.
the primary adjustment to earnings per share is the $num-one add-back of that kemerton revision.
the fourth-quarter net loss attributable to albemarle was $num-one million, reflecting an increased cost estimate to construct our kemerton lithium hydroxide plant due to anticipated cost overruns from the impact of pandemic-related issues on the supply chain and labor.
our second-half sales grew num-one% from the first half of the year, following a relatively flat growth since mid-year-five.
adjusted ebitda grew num-one% in year-six to $num-two million, surpassing the upper end of our guidance.
as kent mentioned, capex is expected to increase to the $num-one billion to $num-two billion range this year as we accelerate lithium investments to meet increased customer demand.
for the fourth quarter, we generated net sales of $num-one million, which is an increase of $num-two million compared to the prior-year quarter.
this implies an adjusted ebitda margin of between num-one% and num-two%.
excluding fcs, fourth-quarter adjusted ebitda was up num-one% from the prior year.
we now expect year-ten lithium demand of approximately num-one million tons, up more than num-two% from our previous estimates.
we'll also continue to work with our customers to improve the sustainability of the lithium supply chain by completing our mine site certifications, scope num-one greenhouse gas assessments, and analyzing product life cycles.
we expect new products to make up more than num-one% of annual bromine revenues by year-ten, up from essentially a standing start.
we expect adjusted ebitda to grow between num-one% and num-two% versus year-six, excluding fine chemistry services.
our procurement cost-saving initiatives and manufacturing excellence projects will be key to offsetting higher raw materials and freight cost as we work to achieve adjusted ebitda margin of between num-one% and num-two%.
