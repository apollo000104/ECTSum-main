as a result of our first half performance and our solid order backlog, we are reinstating our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance to $num-one to $num-two per share.
revenue declined num-one% organically and bookings declined num-two%.
the proactive cost management stance we took in qtr-one and continued in qtr-two has positioned us from a margin performance standpoint, and today we are improving our target for annual decrementals margin to num-one% to num-two%.
we are pleased with the cash generation in the first half of the year, with year-to-date free cash flow of $num-one million, a $num-two million or num-three% increase over last year.
after profitability gains in qtr-one on lower revenue, we targeted num-one% to num-two% decremental margin for the full year.
let's begin with the summary of the results on page num-one.
in europe and asia, integrated oil companies represent a larger share of the network and capital budget cuts resulting from oil price declines are having a more negative impact on investment in the retail network, plus recall we are facing a $num-one million revenue headwind in china this year from the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate, despite some of the top line headwinds with robust margin accretion to date, we expect segment to hold its comparable full-year profit line despite a decreasing top line.
capital expenditures were $num-one million for the first six months of the year, a $num-two million decline versus the comparable period last year.
bookings were down num-one% organically on declines across all five segments, but there are reasons for cautious optimism as we enter the second half.
china representing approximately half of our business in asia, showed early signs of stabilization posting an num-one% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, an improvement compared to a num-two% decline in qtr-one.
we remain confident in the cash flow capacity of this portfolio and reiterating a conversion target above num-one% of adjusted net earnings and a cash flow margin target of num-two% to num-three% compared to num-four% to num-three% target we had last year.
we generated $num-one million more in free cash flow than the comparable quarter last year.
fx continued to be a meaningful headwind in qtr-two, reducing top line by num-one% or $num-two million.
europe was down num-one% on organic declines in all five segments.
qtr-two also benefited from an approximately $num-one million deferral of us tax payments into the second half of the year.
