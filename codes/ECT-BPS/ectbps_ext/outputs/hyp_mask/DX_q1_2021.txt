for the quarter, we recorded a comprehensive income of $num-one per common share, a total economic return of $num-two per common share or num-three%, and a core net operating income of $num-four per common share.
as steve mentioned, book value increased to $num-one or num-two% on a gross basis, less $num-three cost of the capital raises, we get to the net of $num-four or num-five% increase reported for the quarter.
book value per common share during the quarter rose $num-one or num-two%.
our current total economic return for the quarter was num-one% on a quarterly basis, and we have generated a total economic return of num-two% over the last four quarters, averaging num-three% per quarter.
overall, total shareholders' capital grew approximately $num-one million or num-two% during the quarter as we raised $num-three million in net common equity through two public offerings, as byron noted, redeemed $num-four million in higher-cost preferred equity and added approximately $num-five million in capital from excess economic return over dividends paid.
most importantly, since this new era in history began in january year-five, we have outperformed our industry and other income-oriented vehicles with a num-one% total shareholder return as noted on slide five.
core net operating income to common shareholders sequentially improved this quarter to $num-one from $num-two in qtr-four, principally resulting from lower g&a expenses and the reduction in the preferred stock dividend with the redemption of the remaining $num-three million in series b preferred stock outstanding mid-quarter.
roughly num-one% of the $num-two or $num-three of the book value increase was due to the portfolio positioning from the existing portfolio.
this quarter was unique in providing us the opportunity to raise $num-one million in new common equity and invest that capital accretive.
and now -- one-month repo rate now is sitting in the mid-teens, num-one basis points.
the excess economic return was largely driven by our hedging strategy as we actively managed our position and timed our hedging adjustments as the curve steepened during the quarter, resulting in gains of $num-one million, more than offsetting the impact of higher rates in our investment portfolio.
at this point, we're estimating, again, another two to three turns of capacity that offers additional total economic return power of anywhere between num-one% to num-two%.
we're ending the quarter with leverage at num-one times, up about num-two times from year-end.
at the current leverage, which i mentioned, we had delivered post-quarter-end and balance sheet size, which is about $num-one billion higher versus quarter-end -- versus year-end, we still expect core net operating income to continue to exceed the level of the dividend.
the other num-one% of the book value increase came from the timely deployment of capital from the two raises.
and just as an example, one turn of leverage invested at num-one% economic return is $num-two, which represents a meaningful upside to returns from today.
