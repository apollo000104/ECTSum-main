we're expecting adjusted earnings per share of $num-one to $num-two in the fourth quarter with incremental and decremental margins of num-three% to num-four%.
adjusted earnings per share of $num-one to $num-two is lower as a result of this reduction in volume and free cash flow is expected to be $num-three million to $num-four million.
finally, we delivered $num-one of adjusted earnings per share, up num-two% versus prior year and generated free cash flow of $num-three million.
we continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical products with year-to-date orders in backlog up num-one% and num-two%, respectively.
notably, industrial organic orders growth was num-one% in the quarter and our industrial backlog is up num-two% year-to-date, well above pre-pandemic levels.
we expect revenue to be up num-one% to num-two% organically, which includes $num-three million of delayed revenue out of the quarter due to continued global supply chain, logistics and labor challenges.
organic revenue is expected to be flat to down num-one%, which reflects $num-two million of revenue delayed out of the year.
finally, we're planning for free cash flow of $num-one million to $num-two million in qtr-four as we expect supply chain constraints will continue to impact our ability to complete in-process projects and collect milestone billings from customers.
organic revenue was $num-one million, up num-two% versus prior year.
organic orders of $num-one million in the quarter were up num-two% versus prior year.
for industrial, we expect orders in qtr-four to be up more than num-one% and revenue is expected to be up num-two% to num-three% with growth across most end markets.
due to the lower earnings and cash outlook for the year, we now expect to improve our leverage by approximately num-one turns by the end of the year.
orders were down num-one% in aerospace and defense due to the timing of large defense orders.
revenue came in approximately $num-one million lower than expected as a result of the supply chain challenges that scott mentioned upfront.
revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat to down num-one%, with double-digit growth in commercial aerospace and defense aftermarket, offset by lower deliveries on defense programs.
looking forward, we expect these challenges to continue through the fourth quarter, resulting in a $num-one million impact on revenue.
