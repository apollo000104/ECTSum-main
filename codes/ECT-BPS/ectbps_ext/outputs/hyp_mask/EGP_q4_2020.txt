looking forward, ffo guidance for the first quarter of year-six is estimated to be in the range of $num-one per share to $num-two per share and $num-three to $num-four for the year.
ffo per share for the fourth quarter exceeded our guidance range at $num-one per share, and compared to fourth quarter year-four of $num-two represented an increase of num-three%.
brent will speak to our budget assumptions, but i'm pleased that in spite of the uncertainty, we finished year-five at $num-one per share in ffo and forecast $num-two for year-six.
some of the results the team produced include funds from operation, came in above guidance up num-one% compared to fourth quarter last year.
based on the market strength, we're seeing today, our forecast is for $num-one million in development starts for year-six.
this marks num-one consecutive quarters of higher ffo per share as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend.
and for the year, ffo rose num-one% to a record $num-two.
this represents an $num-one per share improvement over our original pre-covid forecast.
finally, same-store noi rose num-one% for the quarter and num-two% for the year.
as a result, our actual ffo per share for the year of $num-one exceeded our pre-pandemic guidance issued a year ago.
further, houston represents num-one% of rents down num-two basis points from fourth quarter year-four and is further projected to fall into the num-three% as a percent of our noi this year.
for january thus far, we've collected approximately num-one% of monthly rents.
our quarterly occupancy averaged num-one% and at quarter end, we were ahead of projections at num-two% leased and num-three% occupied.
our year-five releasing spreads set an annual record at num-one% gaap and num-two% cash.
quarterly releasing spreads were strong at num-one% gaap, and num-two% cash.
i'm grateful we ended the year at num-one% leased, our highest quarter end on record.
