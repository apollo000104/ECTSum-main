today, we are reporting record qtr-three financial results of $num-one billion in sales and non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $num-two, which is up num-three% over last year and up num-four% compared to two years ago.
we expect the following: enterprise revenue in the range of $num-one billion to $num-two billion compared to our previous guide of $num-three billion to $num-four billion, comparable sales growth of num-five% to num-six% compared to our previous guide of num-seven% to num-eight%, and a non-gaap gross profit rate slightly higher than last year.
compared to last year, enterprise revenue grew $num-one million, and our non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $num-two increased $num-three, a lower share count resulted in a $num-four per share benefit on a year-over-year basis.
we expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down num-one% to up num-two% to last year, which is on top of our num-three% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year.
and domestic comparable sales growth was up num-one% on top of num-two% last year.
compared to our guidance, enterprise revenue of $num-one billion exceeded the high end of our revenue outlook of $num-two billion, driven by the better-than-expected comparable sales growth of num-three%.
after delivering significant growth for the past several quarters and lapping a num-one% comp in the third quarter of last year, computing comparable sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis but still up nearly $num-two billion from two years ago.
with a year-to-date share buyback spend of $num-one billion, we still expect to spend more than $num-two billion in share repurchases this year.
for sg&a, we expect growth of approximately num-one%, which compares to our prior outlook of num-two%.
in our international segment, revenue decreased num-one% to $num-two million.
in our domestic segment, revenue increased num-one% to almost $num-two billion.
in addition, our services comparable sales declined num-one% this quarter.
from a non-gaap sg&a standpoint, we are planning dollars to increase approximately num-one% compared to last year.
despite lapping the extraordinary num-one% comparable sales growth from last year, we were once again able to generate positive comparable sales growth in each fiscal month of the third quarter.
from a profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-gaap rate that is approximately num-one basis points below last year's rate due to the estimated impact of our new totaltech offer, which we expect to be partially offset by a more favorable product mix.
as a result of the higher revenue and our ability to adjust to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-gaap operating income rate was num-one basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from two years ago.
