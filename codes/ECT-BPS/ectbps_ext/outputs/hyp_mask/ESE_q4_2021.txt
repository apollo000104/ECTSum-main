all these items delivered adjusted earnings per share of $num-one per share above prior year's $num-two per share.
we have seen some good trends developing with orders and are excited to issue guidance that calls for earnings per share in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million or growth of num-three% to num-four% in fiscal year-seven.
usg saw sales growth of num-one% in the quarter.
below the ebit line, we saw interest expense of approximately $num-one in the quarter compared to nearly $num-two million in the prior year qtr-four.
this earnings per share range assumes year-seven sales in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million or growth of num-three% to num-four%.
the a&d group had a full year sales decline of num-one%, the main driver of the sales drop was commercial aerospace, which was down num-two% for the year, this was somewhat offset by num-three% increase from the navy business.
a&d did see sales weakness in the quarter as previously mentioned, the group was down num-one%, in the quarter we saw declines in all major markets with commercial aerospace down num-two%, space down num-three% and the navy business down num-four%.
we expect a&d to grow sales in the range of num-one% to num-two%, usg to grow in the range of num-three% to num-four% and test to grow num-five% to num-six%.
sales in the fourth quarter were flat to prior year qtr-four with a&d down num-one%, usg was up num-one% and test grew num-two%.
if you exclude the impact of the qtr-four acquisitions, the growth was approximately num-one%.
our test business has seen a nice pickup in its overall piece of business, we had double-digit sales growth there in qtr-four, and we also saw order growth of over num-one%, some exciting numbers.
usg at a full-year sales increase of num-one% excluding the fourth quarter acquisitions the growth was num-two% and this was driven by num-three% growth at nrg.
the energy business grew num-one% for the full year and the fourth quarter was consistent with that as well.
adjusted ebit margins were num-one% in the quarter compared to num-two% in the prior year quarter.
we saw good orders for usg in qtr-four and including the recent acquisitions we move into fiscal year-seven with a record backlog position of $num-one million.
we do have some headwinds next year with increased interest expense to $num-one million in a projected tax rate of num-two% to num-three%, but the plan still deliver strong earnings per share in spite of these items.
