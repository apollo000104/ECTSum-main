we delivered earnings per share of $num-one a share and a return on tangible common equity of over num-two% on an adjusted basis, despite the near-term headwinds that the industry is facing with continued pressure on short-term rates and strong competition given growing levels of excess liquidity and muted loan demand.
given continued improvement in the macroenvironment, overall credit quality, and muted loan growth, we posted a credit to provision of $num-one million, which was down from $num-two million credit last quarter.
this reduction drove a $num-one decline in eps.
i'll briefly touch on slide-num where we outline the notable items in the quarter which reduced our results by $num-one million after-tax or $num-two per share.
as bryan mentioned, tangible book value per share came in at $num-one, up num-two% as gaap net income was largely offset by a $num-three impact tied to the return of capital and a $num-four decline tied to the mark-to-market on the security portfolio in oci.
and our outlook calls for charge-offs to be in the range of num-one to num-two basis points and that it's reasonable to see continued reserve outflows near term.
we generated core net interest income growth of num-one% with underlying loan growth of num-one%, which was driven by a commercial loan growth of num-two%.
we expect the vast majority of the round num-one portfolio to be forgiven by the end of the year and that the round num-two will largely be forgiven by the third quarter of next year.
in addition to merger-related notable items of $num-one million, we recorded $num-two million of non-cash, pre-tax costs tied to retiring legacy iberiabank trust preferred securities in the quarter and expect to record an additional $num-three million next quarter.
finally, we expect our cetxt-num ratio to remain in the num-one% to num-two% range.
as our capital levels remain strong with a cetxt-num ratio of around num-one%, we increased our capital return by nearly num-two% in the quarter, repurchasing num-three million shares of common stock and ended the quarter with a tangible book value per share of $num-four.
fixed income average daily revenue came in at $num-one million compared with $num-two million last quarter.
headline fees were down around num-one% in the quarter.
while overall originations were down num-one% for the quarter, portfolio originations were up num-two%.
adjusted expenses of $num-one million moved higher largely reflecting idiosyncratic items tied to strategic investments and additional costs we incurred tied to markets reopening.
over time, we expect the changes to reduce our overall nsf overdraft fees in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million annually, with changes going into production in august for first horizon and with the february conversion for the iberiabank clients.
