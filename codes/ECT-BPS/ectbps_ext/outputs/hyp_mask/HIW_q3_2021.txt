in last night's release, we updated our year-six ffo outlook to $num-one to $num-two per share, up $num-three at the midpoint from our prior outlook and up $num-four from our initial year-six ffo outlook provided in february.
turning to our results, we delivered strong ffo of $num-one per share in the third quarter.
in the third quarter, we delivered net income of $num-one million or $num-two per share, and ffo of $num-three million or $num-four per share, an increase from $num-five in the second quarter.
regarding our expectations for the rest of the year, we've updated our year-six ffo outlook to $num-one to $num-two per share, with the mid-point up $num-three since july and up $num-four from our original year-six outlook provided in february.
given the emergence of the delta variant, utilization across our portfolio did not increase as much in the third quarter as we anticipated, leveling off around num-one%.
we signed num-one square feet of second gen leases, including num-two square feet of new deals.
as you may have seen from local media reports, two customers in our top num-one announced this quarter plans to move out upon exploration and relocate to new developments.
rolling forward from our prior outlook in july, the rationale for the increase was: $num-one higher per share impact from the combination of the acquisition and corresponding noncore dispositions; $num-one to $num-two higher per share impact due to earlier-than-expected delivery of the asurion build-to-suit; and $num-three to $num-four higher per share impact from core operations due to our robust third quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of the year.
excluding these repayments, same-property cash noi growth would still have been a healthy num-one%, consistent with last quarter.
in addition to healthy volume, rents on signed leases increased num-one% on a gaap basis and num-two% on a cash basis.
as you know, we plan to bring our balance sheet back to pre-acquisition levels by accelerating the sale of $num-one million to $num-two million of noncore assets by mid-year-seven.
moving to investments, as we previously disclosed, we acquired the office portfolio from pac in late july for a total investment of $num-one million, including planned near-term building improvements.
compared to our original ffo outlook provided in february, here are the major moving parts: $num-one to $num-two higher per share impact from acquisition and disposition activity on a net basis; $num-three to $num-one from the early delivery of asurion and faster-than-expected lease-up of the remainder of the development pipeline; approximately $num-four from rising parking revenues, particularly transient parking; and $num-five to $num-one from better-than-expected core operations.
we also raised our same property cash noi growth outlook to num-one% to num-two%, up more than num-three basis points at the midpoint from our prior outlook.
however, if we look solely at the change in second gen net effective rents on signed deals from year-four to year-six year-to-date, the decline is roughly at the midpoint of the num-one% to num-two% average decline across our markets we've mentioned previously, which in our experience is also consistent with the typical recessionary patterns.
the weighted average term was also solid at num-one years reflecting growing confidence in the long-term value of the office for our customers.
