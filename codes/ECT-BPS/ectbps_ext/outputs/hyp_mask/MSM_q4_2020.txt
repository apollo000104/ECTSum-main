our target is to outgrow the markets in which we compete by at least num-one basis points over the cycle.
versus the prior year period, overall sales were down num-one% or num-two% on an average daily sales basis.
and adjusted for severance and other costs, earnings per share was $num-one.
all of this resulted in earnings per share of $num-one.
our results for the quarter reflect the swift cost containment measures we implemented due to covid, including temporary reductions in variable hours, in executive and management salaries, temporary suspension of our num-one(k) match, a hiring freeze, and virus-related travel restrictions.
looking over extended periods of time, average ip growth is in the num-one% to num-two% range.
our fourth-quarter sales were $num-one million, a decline of num-two% versus the same quarter last year.
gross margin was down num-one basis points and operating margin was num-two% as compared to num-three% in the prior year.
our average daily sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $num-one million, a decrease of num-two% on an ads basis versus the same quarter last year.
this also includes about $num-one million of costs related to severance and the review of our operating model mentioned on previous calls.
a key driver was the $num-one million decrease in inventory from last quarter to $num-two million.
total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $num-one million or num-two% of sales versus $num-three million or num-four% of sales in the prior year.
on the growth side of that equation, we're targeting growth rates of at least num-one basis points above market over the cycle by investing in the five growth levers i described earlier.
excluding those costs, operating expenses as a percent of sales were num-one% in the prior year, excluding $num-two million of costs related to severance, operating expenses were also num-one% of sales.
if sales are flat, we would expect operating margin to be in the range of num-one%, plus or minus num-two basis points.
and finally, if sales are slightly up, we would expect operating margin to be in the range of num-one%, plus or minus num-two basis points.
