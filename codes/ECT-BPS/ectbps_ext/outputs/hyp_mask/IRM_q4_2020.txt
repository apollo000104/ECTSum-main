affo was $num-one million or $num-two on a per share basis, in line with our prior projections.
and for the full-year year-six, we currently expect revenue of $num-one billion to $num-two billion.
we expect affo to be in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million or $num-three to $num-four per share.
for the full year, organic volume declined num-one%.
we expect adjusted ebitda to be in a range of $num-one billion to $num-two billion.
for the full year, revenue of $num-one billion declined num-two% on a reported basis, which includes a num-three basis point impact from foreign exchange.
this, all in spite of total revenue being down $num-one million due to service activity declines.
total organic revenue declined num-one%.
looking more specifically at rim organic volume, this was down num-one million cubic feet sequentially.
we maintained our focus on project summit, where we have increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $num-one million to $num-two million, and have already achieved over $num-one million on an annual run rate by the end of year-five.
this was offset by declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year, leading to total organic revenue decline of num-one%.
on a reported basis, revenue of $num-one billion declined num-two%, which includes a num-three basis point impact from foreign exchange.
affo increased num-one% to $num-two million or $num-three on a per share basis.
contributing to this was a num-one million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume.
with our strong financial position, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $num-one per share to be paid in early april.
we are confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve num-one% carbon neutrality well before num-two in spite of our very rapidly growing data center business.
