adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $num-one to $num-two.
net income for the fourth quarter on a gaap basis was $num-one million or a diluted income per share of $num-two compared to a net loss of $num-three million for the prior-year quarter.
we had a full-year net loss of $num-one million or a diluted loss per share of $num-two compared to a net loss of $num-three million for the prior year.
fourth-quarter adjusted net income was $num-one million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-two, an increase from fourth quarter's year-four's adjusted net income of $num-three million.
for adjusted ebitda, excluding the deferred revenue adjustment of $num-one million in qtr-one year-five, we are projecting adjusted ebitda growth in the first quarter to be at the low end of our range as the annualization of cost savings for year-five are partially offset with increased public company costs of approximately $num-two million per quarter in the first half and $num-three million per quarter in the second half.
excluding the deferred revenue adjustment of $num-one million in qtr-one year-five, we are projecting adjusted revenue growth in the first quarter of year-six to be at the low end of our guidance range as we work through the end of the data.com wind-down and the impact of covid.
fourth-quarter revenues were up num-one%, excluding the net benefit of the lower deferred revenue purchase accounting impact.
adjusted revenues are expected to be in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million, an increase of approximately num-three% to num-four% compared to full-year year-five adjusted revenues of $num-five million.
on a gaap basis, fourth-quarter revenues were $num-one million, an increase of num-two% or num-three% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter.
subsequent to the application of these elimination, the incremental adjusted revenues will have a num-txtoint impact on the total full-year growth, which includes the sun-downing of approximately $num-one million in legacy solutions revenues that we expect to have fully run off by the end of year-seven.
additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows: interest expense of $num-one million to $num-two million; depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $num-three million, excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; adjusted effective tax rate of approximately num-four%; weighted average shares outstanding of approximately num-five million; and finally, capex of approximately $num-six million.
we are currently estimating $num-one million of elimination that will be ebitda-neutral but does impact comparability to the prior revenues and expenses reported by bisnode through ratos.
adjusting for the previously communicated headwinds, normalized revenues on a constant-currency basis were up num-one% for the fourth quarter and num-two% for the full year.
this includes the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $num-one million.

we also have identified approximately $num-one million in annualized run-rate savings that we expect to have actioned by the end of year-seven.
