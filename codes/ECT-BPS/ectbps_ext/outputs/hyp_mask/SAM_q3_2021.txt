based on information of which we are currently aware, we're not targeting full-year year-six earnings per diluted share of between $num-one and $num-two.
loss per diluted share was $num-one, a decrease of $num-two per diluted share from the third quarter of year-five.
for the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $num-one million, a decrease of $num-two million from the third quarter of year-five.
we project increases in revenue per barrel of between num-one% and num-two%.
these costs include negative absorption impacts at company-owned breweries and downtime charges at third-party breweries of $num-one million; increased raw material sourcing and warehousing costs of $num-two million; and distributor return provisions for out of code or damaged products of $num-three million; and other costs of $num-four million.
full-year year-six depletions growth is now estimated to be between num-one% and num-two%.
shipment volume for the quarter was approximately num-one million barrels an num-two% increase from the prior year, reflecting increase in our twisted tea, samuel adams and angry orchard brands, partially offset by decreases in our truly hard seltzer and dogfish head brand.
in addition, the third quarter results include indirect costs resulting from the slowing hard seltzer category growth of $num-one million.
we project increases in revenue per barrel of between num-one% and num-two%.
advertising, promotional and selling expenses increased by $num-one million or num-two% from the third quarter of year-five, primarily due to increased brand investments of $num-three million, mainly driven by a media production and local marketing costs, and increased freight to distributors of $num-four million that was primarily due to higher rates and volumes.
full-year year-six gross margins are expected to be between num-one% and num-two%.
this decrease was due to the combined direct and indirect costs related to slowing hard seltzer category growth of $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share, net of the related tax benefit and high operating expenses, partially offset by increased net revenue.
as a result, we have taken $num-one million third quarter charge related to direct costs of the hard seltzer slowdown consisting of inventory obsolescence and destruction -- and related destruction costs of $num-two million; contract termination costs, primarily for excess third-party contract production of $num-three million; and equipment impairments of $num-four million.
our third quarter gross margin of num-one% decreased from num-two% margin realized in the third quarter of year-five, primarily due to the $num-three million direct and indirect volume adjustment costs as a result of slowing hard seltzer growth described and higher materials costs partially offset by price increases.
full year year-seven to gross margins are expected to be between num-one% and num-two%.
our full-year year-six investments in advertising, promotional, and selling expenses are expected to increase between $num-one million and $num-two million.
