for the quarter, we reported gaap diluted earnings per share of $num-one.
on an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $num-one was significantly higher than the prior year, driven as expected by the recovery of elective procedures since the pandemic drop in the second quarter of year-five.
net sales in the second quarter were $num-one billion, a reported increase of num-two% and an increase of num-three% on a constant currency basis versus the same period in year-five.
with the narrowing of our guidance range, we are now expecting reported revenue growth to be num-one% to num-two% versus year-five, with the impact of foreign currency unchanged at about num-three basis points of a tailwind for the full year.
for the quarter, operating cash flows were $num-one million, and free cash flow was robust at $num-two million, and we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of just over $num-three billion.
our reported gaap diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported gaap diluted loss per share of $num-one in the second quarter of year-five.
and finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $num-one million to $num-two billion.
