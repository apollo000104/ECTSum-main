accordingly, we are raising our earnings per share guidance to the range of $num-one to $num-two for year-six from our earlier guidance of $num-three to $num-four.
our record december quarter saw both net income and earnings per share more than double with earnings per share hitting $num-one, more than twice the level of last year's previous record.
our tangible net worth was $num-one million or about $num-two per share.
our inventory at quarter end was down num-one% to $num-two million.
for the quarter we are particularly pleased with our continued solid performance in same-store sales, which increased over num-one% which is on top of num-two% same-store sales growth a year ago.
the combination of gross margin expansion and focused expense management resulted in considerable leverage and a record $num-one of earnings per share for the quarter.
for the quarter, revenue grew num-one% to over $num-two million due largely to same-store sales growth of num-three%.
this expectations assumes we reached the low end of our historical targeted leverage of num-one% to num-two% given we have the bulk of the year still in front of us along with continued uncertainty.
our gross profit dollars increased over $num-one million, while our gross margin rose num-two basis points to num-three%.
importantly, our new unit growth was even stronger at num-one%.
moving on to our balance sheet, we continue to build cash with about $num-one million at quarter end versus $num-two million a year ago.
however, excluding skippers, our inventory is down closer to num-one%.
our operating leverage in the quarter was over num-one% which drove very strong earnings growth setting another quarterly record with pre-tax earnings of almost $num-two million.
the acquisition added num-one locations, including num-two marina and storage operations.
this exceptional growth was driven by even greater comparable new unit growth that exceeded num-one%%.
with about num-one locations globally, we believe our superyacht services business have considerable upside including their charter business, which should contribute in a much larger manner.
