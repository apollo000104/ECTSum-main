we expect earnings per share between $num-one and $num-two, with a currency tailwind of $num-three to $num-four at recent rates.
and on the bottom line, we reiterate our non-gaap diluted earnings per share guidance range of $num-one to $num-two.
in fact, our adjusted earnings per share increased num-one% significant growth, reflecting the pandemic impact last year, and our adjusted earnings per share was $num-two better than consensus with $num-three from stronger operating profit and a penny [phonetic] from a lower than expected tax rate.
as a result of these potential headwinds and given we're only mid way through our fiscal year, we believe it is prudent to update our fiscal year-seven organic revenue growth guidance to num-one% to num-two% from the prior num-three%.
if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $num-one million to $num-two million, down from the prior $num-three million to $num-four million i gave last quarter.
at recent rates, we're expecting a currency headwind on third quarter revenue of $num-one million to $num-two million.
our second quarter organic revenue increased num-one%, reflecting the market impact of covid and health system staffing shortages on procedure volumes, primarily in the united states.
and as a result sales this fiscal year are likely to come in below our $num-one million to $num-two million target.
by segment, we expect cardiovascular to grow num-one% to num-two%, neuroscience num-three% to num-one%, medical surgical num-four% to num-five%, and diabetes to be down mid single digits, all on an organic basis.
we delivered num-one% revenue growth outside the us, including mid teens growth in emerging markets.
and our emerging market growth is up num-one% versus pre-pandemic levels in qtr-two fiscal year-five.
looking down our p&l, we had strong year-over-year improvement in our margins, num-one basis points on gross margin, as we continue to recover from the significant impacts from covid last year and num-two basis points on operating margin, given savings from our simplification program tied to our operating model.
our year-to-date free cash flow was $num-one billion, up num-two% from last year, and we continue to target a full year conversion of num-three% or greater.
for the third quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth of num-one% to num-two% year-over-year.
i know we have more to prove, but i'm confident that our organization, our talented and dedicated num-one plus global employees are up for the challenge.
by segment, we expect neurosciences to now grow num-one% to num-two%, cardiovascular and medical surgical to grow num-three% to num-four%, and diabetes to be down low single digits, all on an organic basis.
