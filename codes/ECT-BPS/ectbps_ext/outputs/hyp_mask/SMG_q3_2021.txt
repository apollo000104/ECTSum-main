bringing things down to the bottom line, gaap earnings were $num-one per share in the quarter and $num-two year to date, an increase of num-three% and num-four%, respectively.
on a non-gaap adjusted basis, which is how we provide guidance, earnings per share in the quarter improved num-one% to $num-two per share and num-three% to $num-four per share year to date.
we were up num-one% in the quarter, and we continue to expect growth of num-two% to num-three% on a full-year basis.
that leaves us right on track with the guidance i provided back in june when we said we expect a sales growth of num-one% to num-two%.
to get to our guidance means shipments in the u.s. consumer would decline by num-one% to num-two% year over year in qtr-four, and for our hawthorne guidance to hold means a range of flat growth to plus num-three%, which is obviously lower than what we've been seeing over the past year.
the current consumer trends, combined with planned higher retail inventory levels, give us a high degree of confidence in our full-year sales growth guidance for the u.s. consumer business, which we set at the range of num-one% to num-two%.
companywide sales were up num-one% in qtr-three and we're now up num-two% year to date.
compared to year-four, we expect pos for year-six to be up more than num-one%.
but net-net, we still expect hawthorne to finish the year with num-one% to num-two% growth on top of last year's num-three% growth.
in the num-txteek period from april through june, pos was down num-one% this year compared to year-five, but it's up num-two% in those same weeks compared to year-four.
if you recall, we originally said bonnie would add $num-one to $num-two to earnings this year.
the across-the-board strength led to the num-one% growth we saw in the quarter, which ended with our largest sales month ever in june.
we've taken full advantage of the unique opportunity that presented itself over the past num-one months and have put ourselves in a great position.
through june, sales are num-one% higher on a year-to-date basis as the business continues to build on its market-leading position.
consumer business, where sales declined num-one% in the quarter but are num-two% higher year to date.
when we subtract consumers who did less gardening this year from those who did more, our data suggests participation was up num-one%.
