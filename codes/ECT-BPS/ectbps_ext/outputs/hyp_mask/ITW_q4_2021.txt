we expect gaap earnings per share in the range of $num-one to $num-two, which is up num-three% to num-four%, excluding one-time tax items from last year.
gaap earnings per share of $num-one included $num-two of headwind from the mts acquisition and related transaction costs.
gaap earnings per share was an all-time record at $num-one, an increase of num-two% versus the prior year.
at the enterprise level, we delivered organic growth of num-one%, gaap earnings per share of $num-two, operating margin of num-three%, and free cash flow of $num-four million or num-five% of net income.
six of our seven segments combined delivered num-one% organic growth, while our auto oem segment continued to be impacted by near-term limitations on auto production due to component supply shortages and, as a result, was down num-two% in the quarter.
free cash flow was $num-one billion with a conversion rate of num-two% of net income which is below our num-three% plus long-term target for free cash flow due to higher working capital investments to support the company's num-four% revenue growth and the strategic decision that we have made to increase inventory levels on select key raw materials, components and finished goods to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers.
the strong growth momentum that we experienced in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew num-one% year over year to $num-two billion, with organic growth of num-three%.
as you can see by segment on the next page, every segment is positioned to deliver solid organic growth in year-seven with organic growth of num-one% to num-two% at the enterprise level.
for automotive oem, our guidance of num-one% to num-two% is based on a risk-adjusted forecast of automotive production in the mid-single digits, plus our typical penetration gains of num-three% to num-four%.
as a result, for the full year, we generated organic growth of num-one%, with each of our seven segments delivering organic growth ranging from num-two% to num-three%.
as a result, revenue grew num-one% to $num-two billion, with broad-based organic growth of num-three%, num-four% if you exclude auto oem, where growth was obviously very constrained due to component shortages at our customers.
and in year-seven, we will reinitiate divestiture processes for five businesses, with combined annual revenues of approximately $num-one million.
so, we're headed into year-seven with strong momentum and the company is in a very good position to deliver another year of strong financial performance, with organic growth of num-one% to num-two% and num-three% to num-four% earnings growth.
and despite a seemingly constant barrage of input cost increases, we expanded operating margin by num-one basis points to num-two%, with another num-txtasis-point contribution from enterprise initiatives.
gaap earnings per share increased num-one% and after-tax roic improved by more than num-two basis points to num-three%.
and our core incremental margin, excluding mts, is in our typical num-one% to num-two% range.
