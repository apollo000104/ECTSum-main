yesterday, we reported fourth quarter year-five net income of $num-one million or $num-two per share.
excluding the special items, fourth quarter year-five net income was $num-one million or $num-two per share compared to the fourth quarter of year-four's net income of $num-three million or $num-four per share.
the current estimated impact by quarter in year-six is $num-one per share in the first quarter, $num-two in the second, $num-three in the third quarter and $num-four per share in the fourth.
the annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $num-one per share compared to the $num-two per share we had in year-five.
in addition, we also reported full year year-five earnings excluding special items of $num-one million or $num-two per share compared to year-four's earnings excluding special items of $num-three million or $num-four per share.
fourth quarter net sales were $num-one billion in both year-five and year-four.
net sales were $num-one billion in year-five and $num-two billion in year-four.
based on the recent num-one% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $num-two million.
ebitda excluding special items in the fourth quarter of year-five of $num-one million with sales of $num-two billion resulted in a margin of num-three% versus last year's ebitda of $num-one million and sales of $num-four billion or a num-five% margin.
the estimate for our year-six combined federal and state cash tax rate is about num-one% and for our book effective tax rate, approximately num-two%.
total company ebitda for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $num-one million in year-five and $num-two million in year-four.
export containerboard prices were $num-one per share above both the fourth quarter of year-four as well as the third quarter of year-five.
regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $num-one million to $num-two million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the jackson conversion since that is still being evaluated, as mark indicated earlier.
excluding special items, the $num-one per share decrease in fourth quarter year-five earnings compared to the fourth quarter of year-four was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment of $num-two; the paper segment, $num-three; lower volumes in our paper segment of $num-four and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $num-five.
these items were partially offset by higher volumes in our packaging segment of $num-one per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $num-two and lower other costs of $num-three per share.
looking at the paper segment, ebitda excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $num-one million with sales of $num-two million or num-three% margin compared to fourth quarter year-four ebitda of $num-four million and sales of $num-five million or a num-six% margin.
