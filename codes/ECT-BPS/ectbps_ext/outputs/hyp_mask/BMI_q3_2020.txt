in summary, earnings per share was $num-one in the third quarter of year-five, an increase of num-two% from the prior year earnings per share of $num-three.
as you can see on slide-num, total sales for the third quarter were $num-one million compared to $num-two million in the same period last year, an increase of num-three%.
sea expenses for the third quarter were $num-one million down $num-two year-over-year with higher personnel costs, mostly offset by lower travel, trade show and other ongoing pandemic impacted expenses.
in municipal water, overall sales increased num-one%, a roughly equal combination of improved order rates and recovery of the backlog built in qtr-two, which as we noted last quarter was the result of lockdown induced manufacturing disruptions which limited our output.
the expense run rate was $num-one million higher than the second quarter's $num-two million reflecting the lifting of the temporary cost actions taken in the second quarter in response to the rapid onset of the pandemic.
gross margin for the quarter was num-one%, up num-two basis points year-over-year.
the income tax provision in the third quarter of year-five was num-one%, slightly higher than the prior year's num-two% rate.
working capital as a percent of sales was num-one% relatively in line with the prior two quarters.
operating profit as a percent of sales was num-one%, a num-two basis point increase from the prior year's num-three% with improved gross profit margins and sea leverage contributing to the strong results.
we continue to have full access to our untapped $num-one million credit facility.
as noted and as anticipated, flow instrumentation sales declined num-one% year-over-year, reflective of the broadly challenged markets and application served globally.
we ended the quarter with approximately $num-one million of cash on the balance sheet as we paid down the small euro line of credit with excess cash.
our year-to-date free cash flow of $num-one million was num-two% higher than the prior year $num-three million and is currently tracking at num-four% conversion to net earnings.
we again delivered strong free cash flow which at $num-one million dollars was consistent with the prior year comparable quarter despite the deferral of our federal income tax quarterly instalment payment under the cares act from the second quarter into the third quarter.
