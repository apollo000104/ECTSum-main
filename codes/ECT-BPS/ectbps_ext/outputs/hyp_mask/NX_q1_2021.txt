we reported net income of $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share for the three months ended [date], year-six, compared to $num-three or $num-four per diluted share during the three months ended [date], year-five.
we reported revenue of $num-one million during the first quarter of year-six, which represents an increase of num-two%, compared to $num-three million during the first quarter of year-five.
looking ahead, on a consolidated basis, we currently expect net sales growth of approximately num-one% year over year in qtr-three.
based on our strong first-quarter results and ongoing conversations with our customers, we are raising our expectations for the year and now expect approximately num-one% sales growth in our north american fenestration segment, approximately num-two% sales growth in our north american cabinet components segment and approximately num-three% sales growth in our european fenestration segment.
on an adjusted basis, net income increased to $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share during the first quarter of year-six, compared to $num-three million or $num-four per diluted share during the first quarter of year-five.
from a cadence perspective for qtr-two, on a consolidated basis, we expect net sales to be up approximately num-one% year over year.
we're now comfortable providing the following full-year year-six guidance: net sales of $num-one million to $num-two million; adjusted ebitda of $num-three million to $num-four million; depreciation of approximately $num-five million; amortization of approximately $num-six million; sg&a of approximately $num-seven million.
to summarize, on a consolidated basis for the full year, we currently expect to generate net sales growth of approximately num-one% year over year to the midpoint of guidance, while maintaining adjusted ebitda margin in the low num-one% range.
the increase in net income was somewhat offset by a $num-one million increase in sg&a during the quarter, $num-two million of which was related to the valuation of our stock-based comp awards, mainly due to an increase in our stock price, and $num-three million of which was due to higher medical claims.
if you adjust for the expected increase in sg&a, the implied incremental adjusted ebitda margin is in the mid-num-one% range.
our north american fenestration segment generated revenue of $num-one million in qtr-one, which was $num-two million or approximately num-three% higher than prior-year qtr-one.
our balance sheet is strong, our liquidity position is solid, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last num-one months adjusted ebitda is unchanged at num-two times as of [date], year-six.
cash used for operating activities was $num-one million during the three months ended [date], year-six, and compared to $num-two million for the three months ended [date], year-five.
on an adjusted basis, ebitda for the quarter increased by num-one% to $num-two million, compared to $num-three million during the same period of last year.
note that this is higher than previously expected due to an increase in stock-based comp expense and more normalized medical costs; interest expense of $num-one million to $num-two million; a tax rate of num-three% to num-four%; capex of about $num-five million; and then free cash flow of approximately $num-six million.
in fact, we did not need to borrow on our revolver during the quarter and still managed to both repay $num-one million in bank debt and repurchase approximately $num-two million of our stock.
