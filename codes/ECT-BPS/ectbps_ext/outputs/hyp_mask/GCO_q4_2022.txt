for adjusted earnings per share, we expect a range of $num-one to $num-two per share with our best current expectation that earnings per share will be near the midpoint of the range.
this resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-one for the quarter, which compares to $num-two last year and $num-three in fiscal year-five.
we expect adjusted earnings per share for fiscal year-eight to be between $num-one and $num-two and believe somewhere close to the middle of the range is where the year will land.
higher sales and this better-than-expected gross margin resulted in double-digit operating income expansion over pre-pandemic levels and record adjusted earnings per share of $num-one, an increase of more than num-two% compared to last year's holiday season and num-three% compared to two years ago.
we opened two stores and closed num-one during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with num-two total stores.
gross margin expansion and meaningful expense leverage drove record operating income for our footwear businesses as we achieved an operating margin above num-one%.
after considering these factors, we expect fiscal year year-eight sales to grow num-one% to num-two%.
qtr-four total ending inventory was down num-one%, compared to fiscal year-five on sales that were up num-two%.
we grew revenue more than num-one% over last year and num-two% over fiscal year-five.
consolidated revenue was $num-one million, up num-two% compared to fiscal year-five.
as for j&m, the quarter started off strong in november, but supply chain challenges led to a significant lack of inventory, which led to j&m sales being down num-one% for the quarter.
we generated $num-one million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $num-two million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to num-three% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $num-four, an increase of more than num-five% over fiscal year-five.
remarkably, we achieved this despite overall inventory being down almost num-one% versus last year and down by one-third compared with the fourth quarter two years ago during the key holiday period.
in summary, fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $num-one million, a num-two% operating margin, compared to $num-three million or num-four% for fiscal year year-five.
much stronger demand and supply constraints pushed inventory more than num-one% below pre-pandemic levels, hampering our ability to capture all of the demand during the holidays and return j&m to pre-pandemic sales.
last quarter, we reported that we had identified the full amount of our $num-one million to $num-two million cost savings target.
