this is a $num-one of earnings per share up $num-two or num-three% versus $num-four in the second quarter last year.
the gain on marketable securities positively impacted earnings per share by about $num-one versus $num-two last year.
and earnings came in at $num-one per share, up num-two% over year-five and up num-three% over the second quarter of year-four.
our year-six free cash flow target range is $num-one million to $num-two million, which reflects our adjusted ebitda guidance range of $num-three million to $num-four million.
reported revenue was up num-one%, including organic growth of num-two% on a comparable basis in local currency revenue as recovered to num-three% of year-four pre-covid levels, supporting a strong recovery from the pandemic lows, even with the unanticipated continued shutdown of many economies, especially in europe, latin america and parts of asia during the first half of this year.
operating profit grew num-one% with a margin rate increase of num-two basis points to num-three%, which is num-four basis points above the pre-pandemic second quarter year-four rate of num-five%.
full-year year-six operating profit is expected to be approximately at the midpoint of our guidance reflecting year-over-year margin rate increases of at least num-one basis points, as we drive adjusted ebitda growth up num-two% versus prior year to approximately $num-three million and earnings per share growth of num-four% to about approximately $num-five per share.
we expect to use that $num-one million of cash for working capital growth and restructuring.
the current year end estimates include the $num-one million acquisition of pai, our adjusted ebitda range and our free cash flow target range.
this slide also shows our preliminary year-seven ebitda target of approximately $num-one million reflecting growth in the mid-teens.
reported revenue was $num-one billion, up $num-two million or num-three% versus the second quarter last year.
adjusted ebitda was up num-one% with a margin rate increase of num-two basis points to num-three% which is a num-four basis points above the pre-pandemic second quarter year-four ebitda rate.
$num-one million of second quarter year-six operating profit plus interest expense and taxes, plus $num-two million in minority interest and other generated $num-three million of income from continuing operations.
our net cash capex target is around $num-one million, an increase of $num-two million over last year driven by acquisitions and a return to more normalized investment.
second quarter reported operating profit was $num-one million, up over num-two% versus last year.
this technical change to net revenue recognition reduced our forecast pai revenue by $num-one million or so of this year, but has no impact on profit, and in fact, actually increases our margin rate.
