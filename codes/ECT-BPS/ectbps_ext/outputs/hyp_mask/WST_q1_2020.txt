full-year year-five net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $num-one billion and $num-two billion.

we recorded $num-one million in gross profit, $num-two million or num-three% above qtr-one of last year, and gross profit margin of num-four% with a num-txtasis point expansion from the same period last year.
the revised guidance also includes a $num-one earnings per share impact from our first-quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

operating cash flow was $num-one million for the first quarter of year-five, an increase of $num-two million compared to the same period last year, a num-three% increase.
capital expenditure will be in the range of $num-one million to $num-two million.
we had num-one% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales.
working capital of $num-one million at [date], year-five, was $num-two million lower than at [date], year-four primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents.

our qtr-one year-five capital spending was $num-one million, $num-two million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
and finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew num-one% for qtr-one.
so to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter, strong top-line growth in both proprietary and contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and earnings per share projections for year-five and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately num-one% to num-two% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.
we saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $num-one million reported this quarter, compared to $num-two million in the same period last year or a num-three% increase.
