for the second quarter that ends in december year-six, we expect net sales to range between $num-one million and $num-two million and after consideration for seasonally higher sg&a level, some normalization of brazil segment profitability and recent increase in oil prices, we expect to achieve an adjusted ebitda between $num-three million and $num-four million.
revenues were up num-one% and versus two years ago, they were up num-two%, so the pre-covid timeframe.
consolidated net sales increased num-one% from $num-two million to $num-three million, primarily due to business recovery we have seen over the last five quarters of sequential sales growth.
for the full year fiscal year-seven, we expect sales to surpass $num-one million, representing a num-two% or more increase from fiscal year-six's revenues.
ebitda grew num-one% versus year ago this quarter -- this year and then up num-two% versus two years ago, so both give us a strong start for fiscal year-seven.
during the first quarter, the strong price mix performance increased sales over num-one% from the year ago quarter, driving more than num-two% increase in gross profit dollars.
you will note that on slide-num, products made with repreve fiber comprised num-one% net sales, consolidated net sales increasing from num-two% in the first quarter of fiscal year-six.
last week, the u.s. department of commerce announced its final determinations that imports of polyester textured yarn from indonesia, malaysia, thailand and vietnam are being unfairly sold below their fair value in the u.s. the financing dumping duty deposit rates range from num-one% to num-two% and are currently in effect.
we expect adjusted ebitda to grow from the fiscal year-six level in a range between $num-one million and $num-two million and our effective tax rate guidance remains in the range of num-three% and num-four%, while our capital expenditures will range between $num-four million and $num-five million.
so you look at repreve sales versus year ago first quarter was up num-one% and then from two years ago, pre-covid, it was up num-two%.
qtr-one revenues were up num-one% sequentially, slightly ahead of our expectations and up num-two% on a year-over-year basis.
in brazil, momentum surrounding higher pricing and market share continued to benefit revenues, as pricing was up over num-one%, driving a significant change in quarterly revenues for that segment.
looking forward, we continue to anticipate a degree of moderation in profit from this region with the full year gross margin settling just below num-one%.
lastly from a segment performance perspective on slide-num and num-one, we've included a two-year gaap comparison for enhanced understanding of this just completed quarter's performance.
slide-num shows the consolidated sales increase of num-one% from the same quarter two years prior lifted by a healthy combination of volume, pricing and mix across our segments.
the asia segment's volume growth led to a $num-one million improvement in gross profit as that segment continues its strong year-over-year growth trajectory and remains a significant component of the global commercial model.
