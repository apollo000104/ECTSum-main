we also reported adjusted ebitda of $num-one million and adjusted earnings per share of $num-two.
last evening, we announced strong third quarter results led by num-one% year-over-year revenue growth.
regarding our outlook, based on what we know today, we now expect fourth quarter revenue growth to be between num-one% and num-two%.
organic revenue was up num-one% versus year-five and was up num-two% versus the pre-covid environment in the third quarter of year-four.
we are narrowing our adjusted ebitda guidance range to $num-one million to $num-two million, given our expectations for continued strong volume growth and accelerated pricing, offsetting raw material cost increases that we now expect to exceed num-three% for the full year.
adjusted gross profit was up num-one% year-on-year but gross profit margin was down as volume growth and pricing gains were more than offset by higher raw material costs.
overall, when considering our strategic pricing actions coupled with the solid volume growth in hhc, continued improving performance in construction adhesives and strong demand in engineering adhesives, we now expect full-year revenue growth of num-one% to num-two% versus year-five.
adjusted ebitda for the quarter of $num-one million was up num-two% versus the same period last year and adjusted earnings per share were $num-three, up num-four% versus the third quarter of last year, driven by strong volume growth, pricing gains and good cost controls offset by higher raw material cost.
this would represent full year ebitda growth in the range of num-one% to num-two%.
through the third quarter, we have implemented $num-one million of price adjustments and we took the decisive step of announcing a september num-txtt increase and surcharge in order to offset further raw material cost increases.
on pricing, we moved quickly to implement $num-one million in pricing actions, which are aligned with the value customers derived from our adhesives.
when compared to qtr-three year-four, organic revenue increased num-one% for the total company with strong organic growth for all three gbus.
adjusting for currency, organic revenue was up num-one% with volume up num-two% and pricing up num-three%.
all three gbus had double-digit organic growth versus year-five with engineering adhesives and construction adhesives up over num-one% year-on-year and hhc up num-two%.
we expect cash flow to be strong for the rest of the year, allowing us to maintain our target to pay down approximately $num-one million of debt during year-six.
these actions are expected to result in more than $num-one million of pricing revenue on an annualized basis.
