fourth quarter gaap net income was $num-one million and gaap diluted earnings per share were $num-two.
we're raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $num-one at the low end of the range and by $num-two at the high end of the range to $num-three to $num-four.
fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $num-one grew num-two%.
on that basis, first quarter revenue is expected to be between $num-one million and $num-two million representing reported growth of num-three% to num-four%.
for the full year gaap net income was $num-one million and gaap diluted earnings per share was $num-two.
adjusted diluted earnings per share grew num-one% in the fourth quarter to $num-two.
the revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $num-one million, which was $num-two million above the high end of our guidance range.
full year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $num-one.
and finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $num-one and $num-two up num-three% to num-four%.
as a result, our next num-one months revenue from backlog increased to $num-two billion, up num-three% year-over-year.
we expect $num-one billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next num-two months, which represent a year-over-year increase of num-three%.
revenue for the full year was $num-one million, which was up num-two% reported and num-three% at constant currency.
and you'll recall that we've committed to deleveraging between num-one times and num-two times net leverage as we exit year-seven and you can expect that we'll make good progress toward this target in year-six due to our double-digit adjusted ebitda growth and improved free cash flow conversion.
we've increased our adjusted ebitda by $num-one million at the low end of the range and by $num-two million at the high end of the range, resulting in full-year guidance of $num-three million to $num-four million.
we're raising our full year guidance by $num-one million for revenue at the low end of the range and by $num-two million at the high end of the range.
the new revenue guidance is $num-one million to $num-two million, a little under half of that increase is driven by a stronger outlook for the business and the remainder is from favorable fx new events versus the guidance we provided on our third quarter call.
