based on our current outlook, we continue to expect core ffo per share for year-six to be between $num-one and $num-two.
first quarter core ffo available to common shareholders was $num-one per share compared to $num-two per share in the first quarter of year-five.
additionally, our guidance assumes there are no further domestic government-mandated shutdowns and assumed lease termination fees decrease by $num-one million to $num-two million, or $num-three to $num-four per share from the elevated level we recognized in year-five.
we expect the year-six net dilutive impact per share to be approximately $num-one for net income, $num-two for ffo, and $num-three for core ffo.
as mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect store closures during year-six related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings to total approximately num-one square feet during year-six, including the num-two square feet we recaptured during the first quarter.
core ffo for the first quarter of year-six excludes general and administrative expense of $num-one million, or $num-two per share for compensation costs related to a voluntary retirement plan and other executive severance costs.
as previously disclosed, we expect to take a charge in the second quarter of year-six currently estimated to be approximately $num-one million, or $num-two per share, including an approximately $num-three million make-whole premium to be paid for the early redemption of the notes and $num-four million in unamortized debt discount and loan costs.
consolidated portfolio occupancy was num-one% at the end of the quarter, up only num-two basis points from the end of year-five.
same-center noi for the consolidated portfolio decreased num-one% for the quarter.
we are encouraged by a greater macro outlook over the past num-one days as vaccination rollout continues and an improving retail environment, as evidenced by the consumer confidence index in late april, reaching its highest level since the onset of the pandemic.
we are maintaining this guidance despite the $num-one dilutive impact previously discussed.
also provided a significant contribution to the other revenues line in the first quarter of year-six, driving a num-one% increase year-over-year.
during the first quarter, we issued num-one million common shares that generated $num-two million in net proceeds at a weighted average price of $num-three per share.
however, this reflects a num-one basis-point improvement on a cash basis, a num-two basis-point improvement on a straight-line basis compared to our reported qtr-four year-five spreads.
blended average rental rates decreased num-one% on a straight-line basis and num-two% on a cash basis for all renewals and retenanted leases that commenced during the trailing num-three months ended [date], year-six.
through [date], year-six, we collected num-one% of the deferred year-five rents due to be repaid in the first quarter and had collected num-two% of all deferred year-five rents, leaving a balance of only $num-three million.
