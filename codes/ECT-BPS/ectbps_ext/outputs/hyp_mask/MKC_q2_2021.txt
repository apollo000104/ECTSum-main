at the bottom line, as shown on slide-num, second quarter year-six adjusted earnings per share was $num-one compared to $num-two for the year ago period.
our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in year-six is now $num-one to $num-two compared to $num-three to $num-four previously.
at the bottom line, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $num-one compared to $num-two in the year ago period, driven lower primarily by a higher tax rate.
the considerable shift in sales between segments resulted in an adjusted operating income decline of num-one% or num-two% in constant currency.
we are also increasing our year-six adjusted earnings per share expectations to num-one% to num-two% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency.
this compares to $num-one of adjusted earnings per share in year-five.
total second quarter sales grew num-one% from the year ago period and constant currency sales grew num-two% attributable to substantial growth in our flavor solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in our consumer segment, both impacted by the factors i've mentioned a few moments ago.
this outlook versus our year-five adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our year-six adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately num-one%.
in fact, we're now projecting the incremental sales contribution of these acquisitions to be at the high end of our num-one% to num-two% guidance range.
year-to-date, we've grown sales and adjusted operating income num-one% and num-two% year-over-year respectively, both of which include num-three% favorable impact from currency, and we've grown adjusted earnings per share num-four%.
in the second quarter, our sales rose num-one% or num-two% at constant currency with double-digit growth in all three regions.
this includes the incremental impact of the cholula and fona acquisitions, projected to be at the high end of the num-one% to num-two% range.
our americas constant currency sales declined num-one% in the second quarter with incremental sales from our cholula acquisition contributing num-two% growth.
starting on slide-num, with our consumer segment comparing to the highly elevated demand levels in the second quarter of last year, sales declined by num-one% or in constant currency, num-two%.
we are now projecting our year-six adjusted gross profit margin to be num-one to num-two basis points lower than year-five.
this projection includes the inflationary pressure i just mentioned as well as our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $num-one million.
