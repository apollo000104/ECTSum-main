net income for the second quarter of year-six included the after-tax cost related to the early retirement of debt of $num-one million or $num-two per diluted common share.

given our strong second quarter results, we are raising our outlook for full year year-six growth in after-tax adjusted operating income per share to a decline of approximately num-one% to num-two% compared to our previous outlook of a decline of num-three% to num-four%.
we now estimate the impact to our capital position to be less than $num-one million rather than the $num-two million we had previously projected, a very good outcome for us, which provides upside to our capital expectations for year-end year-six.
at our outlook meeting this past december, we indicated that our capital plan for year-six -- in our capital plan for year-six, we assumed a negative impact of approximately $num-one million from the adoption of the factor changes.

sales for unum us in total declined num-one% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to a decline of num-two% in the first quarter.
