we are pleased to report num-one basis point margin expansion on pre-tax income, leading to a num-two% increase in earnings per share, up to $num-three per share this year compared with $num-four in the first quarter a year ago.
as a result of this repurchase activity, we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count for year-six within a range of num-one million to num-two million shares, which represents a slight reduction in our full year expectation compared with guidance earlier this year, and we will provide further updates as we progress through the year.
since the end of the quarter through [date], we have purchased approximately num-one additional shares under a num-txt program for a total of approximately num-two million shares repurchased this year to date.
our revised guidance is to grow revenue between num-one% to num-two% and earnings per share within a range of num-three% to num-four% for the full year of year-six compared to the full year of year-five.
future earn-out payments are estimated at approximately $num-one million for the balance of this year, $num-two million next year in year-seven, approximately $num-three million in year-eight, approximately $num-four million in year-nine, and $num-five in year-ten.
in the first quarter, we used $num-one million for acquisitions, including earn-out payments on acquisitions closed in previous years.
also, as a reminder, in the first quarter a year ago, we recorded an additional $num-one million of bad debt expense.
with total revenue growing by num-one% in the first quarter, revenue growth from acquired businesses accounted for num-two% of that growth, with same unit growth up by num-three%.
to put this in context, the total revenue from this segment of our payroll clients represents less than num-one% of cbiz' total revenues.
but after reporting a same unit revenue decline of num-one% for the full year last year, the num-two% first quarter same unit revenue growth within benefits insurance this year is noteworthy.
turning to the benefits and insurance group, total revenue grew by num-one%, with same unit revenue growth of num-two% in the first quarter this year.
in the first quarter, we used approximately $num-one million to repurchase approximately num-two million shares.
our financial services group recorded total revenue growth of num-one%, with same unit revenue growth of num-two%.
this impacts our reported gross margin, which was num-one% on an adjusted basis this year compared to num-two% a year ago.
and operating margin on an adjusted basis was num-one% compared with num-two% a year ago.
these attributes include the proportion, representing approximately num-one% of our revenue that comes from essential and recurring services, including our tax services, insurance services, payroll services and a host of others that our clients rely on us to provide regardless of business conditions.
