i'm pleased to report a very strong finish to the year with fourth quarter core income of $num-one billion or $num-two per diluted share and core return on equity of num-three%, each up meaningfully from the prior year quarter.
adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses was $num-one at year end, a num-two% increase from a year ago.
core income for the fourth quarter was $num-one billion, up from $num-two million in the prior year quarter and core roe was num-three%, up from num-four%.
we're also pleased to report full year core income of $num-one billion, generating core return on equity of num-two%, a substantial margin of the risk-free rate and our cost of equity.
for the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $num-one billion for the first time ever and reflected the benefit of continued increases in premium volume subrogation recoveries from pg&e related to the year-two and year-three california wildfires and lower overall claim payouts as court room and other settlement activity slowed throughout the year due to covid-related shutdowns.
and accordingly, our net unrealized investment gains increased from $num-one billion after-tax as of [date] to $num-two billion after-tax at year end.
new business of $num-one million was down $num-two million from the prior year quarter.
pyd in the current quarter, for which i'll provide more details shortly, was net favorable $num-one million pre-tax.
looking forward to year-six, we expect that after-tax fixed income nii, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $num-one million and $num-two million per quarter as we project that the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio in the lower interest rate environment.
operating cash flows for the quarter of $num-one billion were again very strong.
and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $num-one billion.
the principal driver of the higher level of core income for the quarter was very strong underlying underwriting income, resulting from record net earned premium of $num-one billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved num-two points to an excellent num-three%.
the fourth quarter expense ratio of num-one% brings the full year expense ratio to num-two%.
after-tax net investment income improved by num-one% from the prior year quarter to $num-two million.
the underlying combined ratio of num-one%, which excludes the impacts of cats and pyd, improved by num-two points from the prior year quarter.
and for year-six, wildfires are also capped at $num-one million per event.
