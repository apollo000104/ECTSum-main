in the second quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share.
we did report a net loss of $num-one million in the second quarter or $num-two per share, but that was all due to a very large mark-to-market loss on our hedge contracts of $num-three million and a $num-four million charge related to the early retirement of the senior notes from our [date] refinancing transaction.
adjusted net income, excluding the mark-to-market unrealized hedging loss and the loss on early retirement of debt and certain other unusual items, was a profit of $num-one million or $num-two per fully diluted share.
operating cash flow for the quarter was $num-one million or $num-two per diluted share.
our average daily production for the quarter was num-one% higher than the first quarter of year-six and num-two% higher than the second quarter of year-five.
we had only num-one million a day shut-in during the second quarter, which is num-two% of our production, and that came down substantially from the num-three% we had shut-in, in the first quarter.
excluding those items, our adjusted net income would be $num-one million profit or $num-two per diluted share.
oil prices for the first half of this year have averaged $num-one per barrel.
revenues, including realized hedging losses were $num-one million, num-two% higher than the second quarter of year-five.
we currently plan to retire the year-ten num-one% bonds, probably sometime early next year, just using -- targeting the free cash flow that's generated and using that as a permanent debt reduction moved by the company.
production for the quarter averaged approximately num-one bcfe a day and was num-two% natural gas.
that's num-one% higher than last year, and our realized gas prices averaged $num-two per mcf; both of those numbers, including the impact of our hedging, and that's up num-three% over last year.
we do expect cash g&a to remain in this $num-one to $num-two range kind of going forward.
and then overall, for this period, we reported a loss of $num-one million or $num-two per share.
in addition to lowering our cost of capital, we also improved our weighted average maturity of our senior notes to num-one years, up from num-two years.
but our oil and gas sales, including any realized hedging losses were $num-one million, which is num-two% higher than the first half of year-five.
