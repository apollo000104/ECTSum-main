we're expecting adjusted earnings per share in qtr-four year-six to be $num-one to $num-two per share compared to qtr-four year-five adjusted earnings per share of $num-three per share.
adjusted earnings per share of $num-one a share was down slightly from last year.
we expect revenue in the range of $num-one billion to $num-two billion, reflecting revenue growth of about num-three% to num-four%, including a num-five% benefit from fx.
adjusting for the cloud transformation costs of $num-one million or $num-two a share, adjusted earnings per share would have been up a strong num-three%.
given our very strong third quarter performance, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance by approximately num-one basis points or $num-two million, at the midpoint of a range between $num-three billion to $num-four billion, up num-five% from last year, and increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $num-six per share to a midpoint of $num-seven per share, which adjusting for technology transformation cost implies a num-eight% growth in eps.
excluding these costs, which were excluded from qtr-four year-five adjusted eps, qtr-four year-six adjusted earnings per share would be $num-one to $num-two per share.
we had a very strong third quarter and first nine months of year-six, a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of $num-one billion, which was up over num-two% with core non-mortgage market and non-uc erc claims revenue growth of num-three%.
revenue at $num-one billion was up num-two% with organic constant currency growth of a strong num-three%.
slide-num provides an adjusted earnings per share walk, detailing the drivers of the expected num-one% growth from the midpoint of the year-six guidance of $num-two per share to the midpoint of our year-seven framework of $num-three per share.
our revenue growth has accelerated from num-one% in year-four as we were recovering from the year-two cyber event and investing heavily in our efx cloud transformation to num-two% last year.
in the quarter, we released num-one new products and we still expect our vitality index to accelerate from num-two% last year to over num-three% in year-six.
in qtr-four year-six, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $num-one million or $num-two per share.
for year-seven, based on trends we are seeing in new purchase and refinance that i will discuss shortly, our year-seven framework assumes the u.s. mortgage market as measured by total credit market inquiries will decline about num-one% from year-six.
excluding the impact of tech transformation cost of $num-one per share, adjusted earnings per share in year-six would show growth of about num-two% to num-three% versus year-five.
these costs related to cloud tech transformation negatively impacted ebitda margins by almost num-one basis points.
year-six adjusted earnings per share of $num-one to $num-two per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is up num-three% to num-four% from year-five.
