reported earnings per share for the quarter was $num-one per share compared to $num-two per share in the prior year.
previously, our guidance assumes sales down num-one% to down num-two% organically and earnings per share of $num-three to $num-four per share.
we are narrowing our previous guidance ranges and now expect sales of down num-one% to flat year-over-year or down num-two% to down num-three% on an organic day per day basis as well as earnings per share in the range of $num-four to $num-five per share.
we continue to view num-one basis points to num-two basis points of gross margin expansion as the appropriate annual target over time, given our internal initiatives.
consolidated sales decreased num-one% over the prior year quarter, excluding num-two% growth contribution from acquisitions, sales declined num-three% on an organic basis.
our guidance also assumes gross margins are flat to up num-one basis points for the full year, slightly below our prior guidance of up num-one basis points to num-two basis points.

cash generated from operating activities was $num-one million, while free cash flow was $num-two million or approximately num-three% of net income.
on an organic basis, segment sales declined num-one% reflecting weaker flow control sales and slower activity across our industrial oem customer base, as well as the remaining year-over-year drag from the large project referenced in prior quarters.
lastly, we reaffirm our free cash flow outlook of $num-one million to $num-two million, which represents a num-three% increase of our fiscal year-four at the midpoint.
