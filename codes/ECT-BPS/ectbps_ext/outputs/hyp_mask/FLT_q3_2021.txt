we reported qtr-three revenue of $num-one million, up num-two% and cash earnings per share of $num-three, up num-four%, so both of those all-time record highs for the company.
cash earnings per share at the midpoint to $num-one, that's up $num-two from august.
for qtr-three of year-six, we reported revenue of $num-one million, up num-two%; gaap net income of $num-three million, up num-four%; and gaap net income per diluted share of $num-five, up num-six%.
we also expect sales to grow again next year about num-one%.
ani per diluted share increased num-one% to $num-two.
also, the qtr-three results annualized, finally above $num-one billion, so past the $num-one billion mark in revenue and $num-two in cash eps.
that did shave about $num-one off the $num-two that we reported for the quarter.
so revenue guidance at the midpoint now, $num-one billion, that's up $num-two million from august.
adjusted net income for the quarter, or ani, increased num-one% to $num-two million or roughly $num-three billion annualized.

if you look at the qtr-four on its own, it anticipates revenue and profit growth up about num-one% versus qtr-four last year and about num-two% against qtr-four year-four.
ebitda up almost num-one% versus prior year.
we used $num-one million to repurchase approximately num-two million shares during the quarter at an average price of $num-three per share.
