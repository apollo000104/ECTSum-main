num-one% to num-two% earnings per share growth of $num-three to $num-four is the outlook.
and then, earnings per share was $num-one, our outlook was $num-two to $num-three.
and so, earnings per share was up num-one% or $num-two and then cash was up to $num-three million, a $num-four million above our $num-five million estimate a year ago.
all in, we expect to deliver num-one% organic sales growth and num-two% to num-three% earnings per share growth in year-six.
that gets us to num-one basis points of operating margin expansion and about num-two% earnings per share growth.
qtr-four year-five was num-one% organic sales growth, num-two% domestic organic sales growth, num-three% for international and minus num-four% for spd.
we're going to be down num-one basis points in year-six.
qtr-four finished up a remarkable num-one% behind growth in both our domestic subsidiary markets as well as our gmg business, where a resurgent asia was a key driver of performance.
we finished year-five posting organic growth of num-one%, well above our num-two% evergreen goal.
whether you've been a short term one year shareholder of church & dwight, three, five, num-one or num-two years, you're very pleased with our performance.
so we beat the midpoint of the range by $num-one.
every year, we expect to grow our top line organically num-one% and our bottom line num-two%.
in year-six, we expect it to cross num-one%.
and this is on top of almost num-one% organic growth and num-two% earnings per share growth in year-five, which exceeded our year-five outlook when we last spoke in october.
and then, adjusted earnings per share growth of num-one% to num-two%.
we think we're going to spike up to around num-one% as we add these capacity investments.
