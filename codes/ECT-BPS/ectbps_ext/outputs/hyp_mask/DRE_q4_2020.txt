i am pleased to report the core ffo for the quarter was $num-one per share compared to core ffo of $num-two per share in the third quarter and represented a num-three% increase over the $num-four per share reported for the fourth quarter of year-four.

core ffo was $num-one per share for the full year year-five compared to $num-two per share for year-four, which represents a num-three% annual growth rate.
