same restaurant sales decreased num-one%, and adjusted diluted net loss per share was $num-two.
we expect to achieve approximately num-one% of prior year sales levels, total ebitda of at least $num-two million and diluted net earnings per share of greater than or equal to zero on a diluted share base of num-three million shares.
now turning to the results, the total sales were $num-one billion, a decrease of num-two%.
this negatively impacted our earnings per share by $num-one, which was not adjusted out of reported earnings.
our adjusted debt to adjusted capital at the end of the quarter was num-one%, well within our debt covenant of num-two%.
the entire $num-one million -- $num-two million of impairment charges were adjusted out of our reported earnings.
we permanently closed num-one restaurants in the quarter, six of which were already impaired.
we ended the quarter with $num-one million in cash and another $num-two million available in our credit facility.
during the quarter, we impaired $num-one million of assets as a result of lower sales, reduced profitability and lower market capitalization.
for the full year, we intend to open between num-one and num-two net new restaurants.
with last week's blended same restaurant sales down num-one%, we are operating cash flow positive at these levels.
not much has changed over those num-one years, except today, we order salads instead of two or three entrees each.
this gives us over $num-one billion of liquidity available to weather the crisis and make appropriate investments to grow profitably.
during the quarter, we suspended the dividend and share repurchases, fully drew down our $num-one million credit facility, took out a $num-two million term loan and raised over $num-three million in a follow-on equity offering.
restaurant expenses per operating week decreased over num-one%, given our focus on cost management, even as we incurred over $num-two million in incremental cleaning supplies and ppe related to covid.
it has been num-one weeks since our last earnings call.
