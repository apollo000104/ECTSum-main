we reported adjusted earnings per share of $num-one a share, which increased $num-two or num-three% from the $num-four we reported in prior year qtr-one.
total sales in qtr-one decreased $num-one million compared to qtr-one of last year, but navy and space sales were up $num-two million in a&d, which helped to mitigate the decline in commercial aerospace and test and usg sales were up a combined $num-three million.
coupled with the cost reduction actions we recently implemented, usg delivered an adjusted ebitda margin of nearly num-one%, up from approximately num-two% in the prior year's qtr-one.
the $num-one also exceeded the consensus estimate of $num-two.
following up on the strong cash flow performance of the past year, we kicked-off fiscal year-six with a record amount of cash flow, resulting in a free cash flow conversion ratio of num-one% of net earnings.
today, we have approximately $num-one million of liquidity at our disposal between cash on hand and available credit capacity while carrying a modest leverage ratio of num-two.
given the backdrop of today's covid operating environment, i'm pleased to report that we deliver qtr-one adjusted ebitda of over $num-one million, which is approximately num-two% higher than qtr-one of last year, despite the noted sales decline in a&d that vic mentioned, related to softness within commercial aerospace, which historically is one of our most profitable operating units.
entered orders were solid, as we booked $num-one million in new business and ended the quarter with a backlog of $num-two million with a book-to-bill of num-three%.
our test business delivered a really solid qtr-one by significantly beating our internal expectations and delivering an ebitda margin of nearly num-one% versus num-two% last qtr-one.
we took several cost reduction actions recently, and as a result, we increased our qtr-one gross margin by num-one basis points to num-two% and reduced our sg&a spending by nearly num-three%.
