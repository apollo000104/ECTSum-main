In the second quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $55 million or $0.22 per diluted share.
We did report a net loss of $184 million in the second quarter or $0.80 per share, but that was all due to a very large mark-to-market loss on our hedge contracts of $205 million and a $114 million charge related to the early retirement of the senior notes from our June 28 refinancing transaction.
Adjusted net income, excluding the mark-to-market unrealized hedging loss and the loss on early retirement of debt and certain other unusual items, was a profit of $55 million or $0.22 per fully diluted share.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $196 million or $0.71 per diluted share.
Our average daily production for the quarter was 8% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 6% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
We had only 52 million a day shut-in during the second quarter, which is 3.8% of our production, and that came down substantially from the 6.4% we had shut-in, in the first quarter.
Excluding those items, our adjusted net income would be $118 million profit or $0.46 per diluted share.
Oil prices for the first half of this year have averaged $52.06 per barrel.
Revenues, including realized hedging losses were $325 million, 40% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
We currently plan to retire the 2025 7.5% bonds, probably sometime early next year, just using -- targeting the free cash flow that's generated and using that as a permanent debt reduction moved by the company.
Production for the quarter averaged approximately 1.4 bcfe a day and was 98% natural gas.
That's 22% higher than last year, and our realized gas prices averaged $2.62 per mcf; both of those numbers, including the impact of our hedging, and that's up 34% over last year.
We do expect cash G&A to remain in this $0.05 to $0.07 range kind of going forward.
And then overall, for this period, we reported a loss of $322.5 million or $1.39 per share.
In addition to lowering our cost of capital, we also improved our weighted average maturity of our senior notes to 7.6 years, up from 6.3 years.
But our oil and gas sales, including any realized hedging losses were $657 million, which is 30% higher than the first half of 2020.
