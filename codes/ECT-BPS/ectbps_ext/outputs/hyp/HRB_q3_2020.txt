GAAP loss per share increased $0.08 to $0.66.
Adjusted loss per share increased $0.07 to $0.59 driven by the increase in pre-tax loss and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by an increased tax benefit.
Consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we expect these client growth and net average charge expectations along with Wave to result in revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $24.36.
Starting with revenues, we saw a year-over-year growth of $51 million or 11% to $519 million.
We continue to expect interest expense of $90 million to $100 million and capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million.
Starting with the tax industry, we continue to expect overall return growth of around 1%, with Assisted volume flat to slightly up and DIY growing around 3%.
Regarding share repurchases in the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $66 million at an average price of $23.35.
Collectively, these efforts have led to strong results in our net promoter scores increasing over 3 points.
Client survey scores increased 3 points for price for value and 2 points for overall quality, considering the 9 point improvement in these scores last season, these results are tremendous.
Total operating expenses increased $65 million or 11% to $672 million.
All of these improvements are fueling Wave's impressive performance which continued this quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of over 40%.
We came into this year with a strong financial position after generating over $500 million of free cash flow in fiscal '19.
The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an increase in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $18 million.
The rest of our financial outlook also remains unchanged with total depreciation and amortization of $165 million to $175 million, of which $70 million to $80 million will be amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions.
This year, we realized approximately $15 million of unplanned one-time expenses -- one-time expense increases, due to legal cost and Refund Advance fees, which will also impact our margin.
