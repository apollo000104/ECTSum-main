For the second quarter that ends in December 2021, we expect net sales to range between $185 million and $190 million and after consideration for seasonally higher SG&A level, some normalization of Brazil segment profitability and recent increase in oil prices, we expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA between $14 million and $15 million.
Revenues were up 39% and versus two years ago, they were up 9%, so the pre-COVID timeframe.
Consolidated net sales increased 38.5% from $141.5 million to $196 million, primarily due to business recovery we have seen over the last five quarters of sequential sales growth.
For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect sales to surpass $750 million, representing a 12% or more increase from fiscal 2021's revenues.
EBITDA grew 119% versus year ago this quarter -- this year and then up 62% versus two years ago, so both give us a strong start for fiscal 2022.
During the first quarter, the strong price mix performance increased sales over 50% from the year ago quarter, driving more than 100% increase in gross profit dollars.
You will note that on Slide 4, products made with REPREVE fiber comprised 37% net sales, consolidated net sales increasing from 36% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its final determinations that imports of polyester textured yarn from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are being unfairly sold below their fair value in the U.S. The financing dumping duty deposit rates range from 2% to 56% and are currently in effect.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow from the fiscal 2021 level in a range between $65 million and $67 million and our effective tax rate guidance remains in the range of 35% and 40%, while our capital expenditures will range between $40 million and $44 million.
So you look at REPREVE sales versus year ago first quarter was up 39% and then from two years ago, pre-COVID, it was up 27%.
Q1 revenues were up 6% sequentially, slightly ahead of our expectations and up 39% on a year-over-year basis.
In Brazil, momentum surrounding higher pricing and market share continued to benefit revenues, as pricing was up over 50%, driving a significant change in quarterly revenues for that segment.
Looking forward, we continue to anticipate a degree of moderation in profit from this region with the full year gross margin settling just below 20%.
Lastly from a segment performance perspective on slide 7 and 8, we've included a two-year GAAP comparison for enhanced understanding of this just completed quarter's performance.
Slide 7 shows the consolidated sales increase of 8.9% from the same quarter two years prior lifted by a healthy combination of volume, pricing and mix across our segments.
The Asia segment's volume growth led to a $2.4 million improvement in gross profit as that segment continues its strong year-over-year growth trajectory and remains a significant component of the global commercial model.
