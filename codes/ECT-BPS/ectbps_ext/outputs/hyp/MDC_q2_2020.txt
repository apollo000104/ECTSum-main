Net income increased 55% to $84.4 million or $1.31 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020.
This momentum continued into June, with net orders eclipsing last year's June totals by 53%.
For the quarter, net orders were up 5%, given the uncertainties and sales obstacles we faced at the end of the first quarter.
We are anticipating home deliveries for the third quarter of 2020 to be between 1,902 and 2,100.
For the full year, we are estimating to deliver between 7,700 and 8,000 homes.
The increase in units delivered was slightly offset by a 4% decrease in our average selling price to about $467,000.
As previously mentioned, our gross margin from home sales improved by 70 basis points year-over-year to 20.2%.
Gross margin from home sales for the 2020 third quarter is expected to again approximate 20%, excluding impairments and warranty adjustments, consistent with the 2020 second quarter.
However, even with the drop in lot approvals, our lot supply to end the quarter was 6% higher than at the same point in 2019.
Given these favorable market conditions, we are now targeting 8,000 home deliveries for the 2020 full year.
Homes delivered increased 25% year-over-year to 1,900, driven by an increase in the number of homes we had in backlog to start the quarter.
For the third and fourth quarters, we currently estimate a 25% tax rate, excluding any discrete items.
Both our homebuilding and financial services businesses contributed to these year-over-year improvements as pre-tax income from our homebuilding operations increased $23.3 million or 38%, and our financial services pre-tax income increased $14 million or 110%.
Our tax rate decreased from 26.6% to 24.4% for the 2020 second quarter.
We demonstrated solid operating leverage for the quarter as our SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues decreased 90 basis points year-over-year to 10.4%.
This decrease was in line with our strategic focus on affordability as a percentage of our deliveries for more affordable product collections rose to 54% for the second quarter of 2020 versus 44% for the same period a year ago.
