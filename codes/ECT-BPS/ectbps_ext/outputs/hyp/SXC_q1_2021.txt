Our first quarter net income attributable to SXC was $0.20 per share, up $0.14 versus the prior-year period, mainly driven by our Logistics segment performance.
We achieved record-setting first quarter results with adjusted EBITDA of $70.6 million, a 14% improvement over Q1 2020.
Given our very strong first quarter 2021 results and looking at the API2 forward curve, we now expect to deliver at the higher end or possibly even exceed our Logistics adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $20 million to $25 million.
We now expect results at the top end of our 2021 guidance of $215 million to $230 million.
Looking at our capital structure and deployment of cash in the first quarter, we reduced debt by $33 million during the quarter and continued to execute on our deleveraging initiative, while also maintaining our $0.06 per share quarterly dividend.
We also paid dividends worth $5.1 million at the rate of $0.06 per share during the quarter.
We expect to handle approximately 5 million tons of coal at CMT as compared to our original guidance of 4 million to 5 million tons, along with 2.5 million to 3 million tons of other products for which the guidance remains unchanged.
We are well on our way to achieving our long-term gross leverage target of 3 times or lower by the end of this year.
Adjusted EBITDA came in at $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, up $8.5 million versus the first quarter of 2020.
The Logistics business generated $10.9 million of adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to $3.3 million in the prior year period.
In total, we ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position of approximately $386 million.
CMT handled 1.6 million more tons versus the prior-year period, mainly driven by higher coal exports and iron ore.
The increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to higher throughput volumes at CMT. Our Logistics business handled 5.3 million tons of throughput volumes during the quarter as compared to 4.2 million tons during the prior-year period.
First quarter adjusted EBITDA per ton was $61 on 1,038,000 sales ton.
