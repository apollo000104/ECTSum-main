For the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.20 per share, which again would represent a new high for Koppers beating our previous high of $3.68 per share back in 2017.
2020's expected result would represent an approximate 30% increase over 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $3.18.
Our consolidated sales for the year at $1.67 billion represents a new high in the fourth consecutive year of growth when we exclude KJCC from prior results.
On Slide 22, consolidated sales were $393 million, an increase of $11 million from sales of $382 million in the prior-year quarter.
It will also be the fifth straight year with adjusted EBITDA margins between 12% and 14% after seven straight years with margins hovering between 8% and 11%, just another indication of how we have truly transformed our business model.
Throughout 2020, we saw a 30% increase in leading activities and a corresponding 20% decrease in recordable cases, which is quite significant.
Now, while not yet final, we do expect to finish the year with a new high for operating profit of approximately $161 million, which would represent a 28% increase from 2019.
Now this compares to $201 million earned in 2019 and exceeds both our recent guidance range of $204 million to $210 million and even more incredibly exceeds our original pre-pandemic guidance for the year of $200 million to $210 million of EBITDA.
Sales for RUPS were $168 million, flat as compared to the prior-year quarter.
That level of EBITDA equates to a margin of 12.6% to 12.7%, which will be our highest margin since 2017.
PC sales rose to $130 million from $105 million, and CM&C sales came in at $95 million, down from $108 million.
2020 will also represent a new-high watermark for adjusted EBITDA excluding KJCC as we expect to finish between $211 million and $212 million.
Due to all the hard work and dedication of our global workforce, we are on track to achieve a new high of profitability post KJCC to surpass the high-end of our initial 2020 earnings target, to exceed our original net-debt reduction objective of $120 million, and to reduce our net leverage to 3.5, below our pre-pandemic 2020 goal of 3.6 to 3.8.
As of December 31, 2020, total debt was at $784 million.
On Slide 23, adjusted EBITDA for RUPS was $10 million, which was the same as the prior year.
We also recently began using a pool-testing method to screen all U.S.-based plant employees on a periodic basis as that is the employee base where 99% of our infections have come from.
