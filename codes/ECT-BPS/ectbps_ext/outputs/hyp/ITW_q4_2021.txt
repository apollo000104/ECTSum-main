We expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $8.90 to $9.30, which is up 10% to 15%, excluding one-time tax items from last year.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 included $0.02 of headwind from the MTS acquisition and related transaction costs.
GAAP earnings per share was an all-time record at $8.51, an increase of 28% versus the prior year.
At the enterprise level, we delivered organic growth of 5%, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, operating margin of 22.7%, and free cash flow of $695 million or 114% of net income.
Six of our seven segments combined delivered 12% organic growth, while our Auto OEM segment continued to be impacted by near-term limitations on auto production due to component supply shortages and, as a result, was down 16% in the quarter.
Free cash flow was $2.3 billion with a conversion rate of 84% of net income which is below our 100% plus long-term target for free cash flow due to higher working capital investments to support the company's 15% revenue growth and the strategic decision that we have made to increase inventory levels on select key raw materials, components and finished goods to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers.
The strong growth momentum that we experienced in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 5.9% year over year to $3.7 billion, with organic growth of 5.3%.
As you can see by segment on the next page, every segment is positioned to deliver solid organic growth in 2022 with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level.
For Automotive OEM, our guidance of 6% to 10% is based on a risk-adjusted forecast of automotive production in the mid-single digits, plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3%.
As a result, for the full year, we generated organic growth of 12%, with each of our seven segments delivering organic growth ranging from 6% to 18%.
As a result, revenue grew 15% to $14.5 billion, with broad-based organic growth of 12%, 14% if you exclude Auto OEM, where growth was obviously very constrained due to component shortages at our customers.
And in 2022, we will reinitiate divestiture processes for five businesses, with combined annual revenues of approximately $500 million.
So, we're headed into 2022 with strong momentum and the company is in a very good position to deliver another year of strong financial performance, with organic growth of 6% to 9% and 10% to 15% earnings growth.
And despite a seemingly constant barrage of input cost increases, we expanded operating margin by 120 basis points to 24.1%, with another 100-basis-point contribution from enterprise initiatives.
GAAP earnings per share increased 28% and after-tax ROIC improved by more than 300 basis points to 29.5%.
And our core incremental margin, excluding MTS, is in our typical 35% to 40% range.
