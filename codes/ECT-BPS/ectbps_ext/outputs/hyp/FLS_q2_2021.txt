Our revised adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $1.45 to $1.65 for 2021.
We are pleased with the performance and solid results in the second quarter, including adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, which represents a 32% sequential improvement and reflects our continued transformation progress.
Based on the combination of our strong first half bookings, driven mostly by shorter-cycle aftermarket and MRO activities and visibility into improving end markets, Flowserve was pleased to increase our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the full year to $1.45 to $1.65.
Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, excluded just $0.02 of net items, including realignment expenses, the logo line FX charges and a gain on sale of business.
Looking at Flowserve's second quarter financial results in greater detail, our reported earnings per share of $0.35 increased significantly over the prior year period.
These statements are based upon forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of August 6, 2021, and they involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control.
In addition, the quality of our earnings also improved, with after-tax adjusted items declining from $61 million in the prior year period to just $3 million this quarter.
Our guidance is now for 2021 revenues to be 2% to 4% down compared to last year versus the prior guidance of down 3% to 5%.
We were encouraged by our bookings of $953 million, which is nearly an 18% year-over-year improvement.
We saw a modest 20 basis point sequential decrease to 29.4%, driven primarily by accounts payable as well as a 4-day improvement in DSO versus the first quarter.
In terms of other guidance metrics, our net interest expense remains unchanged at $55 million to $60 million, and we modestly lowered our adjusted tax rate guidance to 21% to 23%.
Our adjusted earnings per share target range continues to exclude expected realignment expenses of approximately $25 million as well as below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items which may occur during the year.
In closing, we began our Flowserve 2.0 transformation journey in 2008.
We are pleased with the 17.9% year-over-year increase, which brought this quarter's total bookings to $953 million.
Both original equipment and aftermarket bookings grew in the 17% to 19% range.
Despite our backlog increase of $66 million, some progress delays due to COVID and the proactive purchasing of certain inventory items to mitigate potential supply chain issues, we were pleased that our inventory, including contract assets and liabilities, decreased a modest $4 million sequentially.
