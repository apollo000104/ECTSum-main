We reported net income of $591 million or $0.61 per share for the first quarter.
As Chris said, it was a strong start to the year with net income from continuing operations of $0.61 per common share, up 9% from the prior quarter and over four times from the year-ago period.
On a per share basis, this is an increase of 9% from the fourth-quarter results and up significantly from the year-ago period.
We also identified 70 branches for consolidation representing approximately 7% of our network.
Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.012 billion for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $989 million a year ago and $1.043 billion for the prior quarter.
Average deposits totaled $138 billion for the first quarter of 2021, up $28 billion or 25% compared to the year-ago period and up 1.5% from the prior quarter.
We leverage the strength of our business model by raising over $13 billion for our commercial clients of which we retained approximately 19% on our balance sheet.
Our board of directors also approved our first-quarter common stock dividend of 18 and half cents a share.
We have reduced our net charge-off guidance, which is now expected to be in the 35 to 45-basis-point range for the year.
Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $1.071 billion compared to $931 million last year and $1.1 billion in the prior quarter.
Our net interest margin was 2.61% for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 3.01% for the same period last year and 2.7% from the prior quarter.
This leaves us with a capacity of up to $765 million for the next two quarters.
We reported a record $8.3 billion of originations in 2020, and we expect to eclipse that level this year.
Linked quarter average loan balances were down 1%, reflecting lower commercial utilization rates and a reduction in average PPP balances.
The interest-bearing deposit costs came down another 3 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020, following an 8-basis-point decline last quarter.
This quarter, we repurchased $135 million of common shares.
