We generated $582 million in total revenue and $489 million in net revenue.
Not surprising, services revenue is down 21% from the prior year, but on-premise volume was down 25% for that same period.
We facilitated the sale of 753,000 vehicles, representing gross auction proceeds of $11.4 billion.
This metric was also up sequentially from $304 in Q4.
We are pleased with the increase in auction fees per vehicle sold, increasing 6% to $313 from $296 last year.
I would point out that we were able to increase our gross profit per vehicle sold in the ADESA segment to $264 in Q1 of this year versus $228 in Q1 of last year and $242 in Q1 of 2019.
Despite a 23% year-over-year increase in revenue from purchased vehicles, we experienced a 100 basis point improvement in gross profit due to decreased losses on purchased vehicles.
And the revenue per loan transaction, which in Q1 was $177.
In Q1, $165 million.
Adjusted EBITDA, Q1 $123 million, I believe that adjusted EBITDA remains the most relevant metric of KAR's earnings performance and will continue to be a key metric for myself and the management team.
Again, in Q1, this was 100,000 vehicles, representing 81% growth versus Q1 of last year.
And we generated adjusted EBITDA of $123 million, an increase of 39% versus Q1 of last year.
We generated a total gross profit of $251 million, representing 51% of net revenue.
While lower transaction volumes in all auction channels were clearly a headwind for AFC, we saw strong unit economics with revenue per loan transaction up to 177 from 155 a year ago.
In Q1, this was $186.
Net losses on the sale of vehicles returned under the ADESA Assurance program were approximately 33% of the premiums earned in the first quarter.
