NCR's stand-alone non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.02 higher at $0.64.
In the bottom left, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.62, up $0.35 or 130% from the prior-year second quarter.
For EPS, we expect a range of $1.30 to $1.50, which includes the immediate accretion for Cardtronics of more than 10%.
For revenue, we expect NCR stand-alone of $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, representing 6.5% to 7.5% year-over-year growth.
This includes 11% growth for NCR stand-alone and an incremental 2% growth for the 10 days following the close of the Cardtronics transaction.
In the second quarter, we delivered 13% total revenue growth.
Consolidated revenue was $1.68 billion, up $193 million or 13% versus the 2020 second quarter, driven by very strong growth in both our retail and Hospitality segments and more modest growth in Banking.
That accretion will increase to our targeted 20% to 25% within the first full year of the combination.
Total company revenue then is expected to be $4 billion to $4.1 billion, including intercompany eliminations.
Total company adjusted EBITDA is then expected to be between $700 million and $750 million.
We remain very excited about the transaction as the addition of Cardtronics will accelerate our NCR-as-a-Service strategy and is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for the first full year by 20% to 25%.
Revenue was up $133 million or 9% sequentially.
In the second quarter, software and services represented 69% of our revenue, which is a modest decrease from the 72% in the year ago driven by SCO and POS hardware revenue this year.
NCR stand-alone recurring revenue growth grew 11% over second quarter of 2020.
Cardtronics operations are expected to generate revenue of about $600 million, representing approximately 8% year-over-year growth for them.
