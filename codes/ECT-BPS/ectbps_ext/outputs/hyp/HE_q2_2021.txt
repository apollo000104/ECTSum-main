Our revised Bank guidance is $0.79 to $0.94 per share, up from our prior guidance of $0.67 to $0.74.
Our consolidated net income for the quarter was $63.9 million with earnings per share of $0.58, 31% and 29%, respectively, above the same quarter last year.
Consolidated earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.45 in the same quarter last year, a 29% increase quarter-over-quarter.
As a result, we're increasing our consolidated earnings per share guidance to $2 to $2.20 per share.
We now expect capex to be in the $310 million to $335 million range for the year compared to our prior capex guidance of $335 million to $355 million.
This followed a great first quarter, and for the first half of the year, our consolidated net income and earnings per share were up 56% compared to the first half of 2020.
While this means our forecasted rate base growth is now 3% to 4% from a 2020 base year, we don't expect this year's lower capex range to impact the long-term earnings growth.
We still expect to realize 4% to 5% Utility earnings growth, not including potential upside from PIMs starting in 2022, the first full year of PBR.

For condos, prices were up 8% and sales were up 58%.
We also had about $1 million higher in depreciation.
$2 million of this increase related to a change in the timing for revenue recognition within the year with target revenues recognized on an annual basis remaining unchanged; $1 million from lower non-service pension costs due to the reset of pension costs included in rates as part of a final rate case decision; and $1 million lower expense -- lower Enterprise Resource Planning system implementation benefits to be passed on to customers as we have already fully delivered on our commitment to provide customer savings under this program for Hawaiian Electric.
