Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average.
Average and ending adjusted loans declined 1% from the prior quarter.
Based on this quarter's credit performance and the improving economic outlook, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by $142 million more than net charge-offs, while still maintaining one of the strongest allowance to loan ratios in the industry at 2.44%.
Adjusted non-interest income decreased 2% from the prior quarter, but reflects a 32% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Based on current expectations, we believe the peak is behind us, and we expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 40 basis points to 50 basis points.
Based on our internal stress testing framework and amount of capital we need to run our business, we are updating our operating range for common equity Tier 1 to 9.25% to 9.75% with a goal of managing to the midpoint over time.
Higher average hedge notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the fourth quarter.
Net interest margin declined during the quarter to 3.02%.
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated 10.3% this quarter.
PPP related NII declined $14 million from the prior quarter, as the benefits from round two were offset by slower round one forgiveness.
Interest bearing deposit costs fell 2 basis points in the quarter to 11 basis points contributing $4 million and 1 basis point of margin.
Loan hedges added $102 million to NII and 31 basis points to the margin.
Net interest income decreased 4% on a reported basis or 1% excluding the impact from day count and PPP.
At current rate levels, we expect a little over $100 million of hedge related interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in 2023.
Within the quarter, we repositioned a total of $4.3 billion of cash flow swaps and floors targeting less protection in 2023 and 2024.
Although, we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate 2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020, but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels.
