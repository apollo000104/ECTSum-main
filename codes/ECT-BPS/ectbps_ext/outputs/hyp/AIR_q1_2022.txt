Compared to the prior year period, sales were up 14% from $401 million to 405 -- $455 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 206% from $0.17 per share to $0.52 per share.
Sales in our Expeditionary Services segment were down $17.7 million, reflecting the divestiture of our Composites business and strong performance of the U.S. Air Force pallet contract in the prior year quarter.
Gross profit margin in the quarter was 14.2% versus 12.1% in the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margin was 16.1% versus 13% in the prior year quarter.
Our sales in the quarter of $455.1 million were up 14% or $54.3 million year-over-year.
We recognized $10 million of charges primarily related to this termination and an asset impairment.
As John indicated, we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of $17.5 million as we continue to reduce our rotables and inventory balances.
Our sales to commercial customers increased 52% and our sales to government and defense customers decreased 17%.
Sales inour Aviation Services segment were up 19.8% driven by recovery in our commercial markets.
Our operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter on an adjusted basis up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter.
This is down from 11.3% in the year ago quarter and 11.2% in Q4.
For context, our margin this quarter was actually higher than 2 years ago prior to the pandemic even though our revenue was down $86 million or 16%.
Average diluted share count for the quarter was $35.7 million versus $35 million for the prior year quarter.
Second, we announced a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft modified to allow the DoE to quickly transition between passenger and cargo modes.
SG&A expenses in the quarter were $49.3 million or 10.8% of sales excluding severance of about $1 million, this would have been closer to 10.6% of sales.
Excluding the impact of that AR program, our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operation was $26 million.
We are particularly pleased that our sequential growth from Q4, Q1 was 4%, notwithstanding the fact that our first quarter typically declines from our fourth quarter as a result of seasonality in our business.
