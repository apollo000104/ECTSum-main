Higher revenue in excess of pre-pandemic levels, combined with SG&A that remains well managed, led to significantly higher operating income versus fiscal '20, and Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 compared to $0.33 in fiscal '20.
Next, higher operating profit, combined with pre-pandemic share repurchases delivered outstanding Q1 earnings per share of $0.79, compared with a loss of $3.65 last year with positive earnings per share of $0.33 two years ago, all on an adjusted basis.
First, revenue and operating profit exceeded pre-pandemic levels, increasing 9% and 125%, respectively, over Q1 Fiscal '20 two years ago, even with our stores opened for a little less than 90% of the possible operating days in the quarter, given closures primarily in the U.K. and Canada.
We entered the pandemic year from a position of strength following 11 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth in our footwear businesses.
We closed 17 stores and opened one during the first quarter.
In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was 539 million, up 9% compared to fiscal '20, driven by continued strength in e-commerce, up 144% versus fiscal '20 combined with strong results from Journeys and licensed brands compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Directionally, the overall sales increase for Q2 compared to fiscal '20 could be a little less than the 9% increase we experienced in Q1.
As a reminder, our initial target for this year is to identify savings in operating expenses of 25 million to 30 million or approximately 3% on an annualized basis.
For comparison purposes, we believe that comparing to two years ago, our pre-pandemic fiscal '20 provides the most meaningful assessment of current performance is there is simply too much noise in fiscal 21's results for drawing informative comparisons.
The annual tax rate is expected to be approximately 32%.
This was on top of a 23% cash rent reduction or 22% on a straight-line basis for 123 renewals last year.
The announced recovery plan is centered around new product technology and innovation with 90% of new product development focused on expansion of its casual offering.
In Q1 this year, we negotiated 48 renewals and achieved a 29% reduction in cash rent or 27% on a straight-line basis in North America.
In summary, the first quarter's adjusted operating income was 18.8 million versus fiscal '20's 8.4 million.
During fiscal '19 and '20, we identified 43 million in expense savings, and in addition, following the divestiture of Lids, we eliminated the 9 million stranded costs associated with that business.
On top of this, Journeys' online team delivered e-commerce sales that more than doubled pre-pandemic levels as new website visitors increased by almost 30% and generated close to 50% of Q1 online revenue.
