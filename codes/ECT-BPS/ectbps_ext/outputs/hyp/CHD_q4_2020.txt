6% to 8% earnings per share growth of $3 to $3.06 is the outlook.
And then, earnings per share was $0.53, our outlook was $0.50 to $0.52.
And so, earnings per share was up 15% or $2.83 and then cash was up to $990 million, a $400 million above our $890 million estimate a year ago.
All in, we expect to deliver 3% organic sales growth and 6% to 8% earnings per share growth in 2021.
That gets us to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and about 8% earnings per share growth.
Q4 2020 was 10.8% organic sales growth, 11% domestic organic sales growth, 14.9% for international and minus 1.2% for SPD.
We're going to be down 60 basis points in 2021.
Q4 finished up a remarkable 14.9% behind growth in both our domestic subsidiary markets as well as our GMG business, where a resurgent Asia was a key driver of performance.
We finished 2020 posting organic growth of 8.6%, well above our 6% Evergreen goal.
Whether you've been a short term one year shareholder of Church & Dwight, three, five, 10 or 15 years, you're very pleased with our performance.
So we beat the midpoint of the range by $0.02.
Every year, we expect to grow our top line organically 3% and our bottom line 8%.
In '21, we expect it to cross 30%.
And this is on top of almost 10% organic growth and 15% earnings per share growth in 2020, which exceeded our 2020 outlook when we last spoke in October.
And then, adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%.
We think we're going to spike up to around 3.5% as we add these capacity investments.
