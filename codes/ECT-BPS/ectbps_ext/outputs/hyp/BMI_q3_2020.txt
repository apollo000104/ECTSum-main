In summary, earnings per share was $0.51 in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 16% from the prior year earnings per share of $0.44.
As you can see on slide 4, total sales for the third quarter were $113.6 million compared to $108.6 million in the same period last year, an increase of 5%.
SEA expenses for the third quarter were $25.5 million down $300,000 year-over-year with higher personnel costs, mostly offset by lower travel, trade show and other ongoing pandemic impacted expenses.
In municipal water, overall sales increased 11%, a roughly equal combination of improved order rates and recovery of the backlog built in Q2, which as we noted last quarter was the result of lockdown induced manufacturing disruptions which limited our output.
The expense run rate was $2.3 million higher than the second quarter's $23.2 million reflecting the lifting of the temporary cost actions taken in the second quarter in response to the rapid onset of the pandemic.
Gross margin for the quarter was 39.6%, up 120 basis points year-over-year.
The income tax provision in the third quarter of 2020 was 23.9%, slightly higher than the prior year's 22.1% rate.
Working capital as a percent of sales was 23% relatively in line with the prior two quarters.
Operating profit as a percent of sales was 17.2%, a 210 basis point increase from the prior year's 15.1% with improved gross profit margins and SEA leverage contributing to the strong results.
We continue to have full access to our untapped $125 million credit facility.
As noted and as anticipated, flow instrumentation sales declined 18% year-over-year, reflective of the broadly challenged markets and application served globally.
We ended the quarter with approximately $94 million of cash on the balance sheet as we paid down the small euro line of credit with excess cash.
Our year-to-date free cash flow of $67.8 million was 22% higher than the prior year $55.6 million and is currently tracking at 187% conversion to net earnings.
We again delivered strong free cash flow which at $19.1 million dollars was consistent with the prior year comparable quarter despite the deferral of our federal income tax quarterly instalment payment under the CARES Act from the second quarter into the third quarter.
