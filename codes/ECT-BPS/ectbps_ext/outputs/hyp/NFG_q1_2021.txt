Switching to our outlook for the rest of the year, we've revised our guidance range higher, now projecting earnings to be between $3.65 and $3.95 per share, a $0.10 increase at the midpoint.
Based on our strong first quarter well results and solid execution by our operations team, we are revising our production guidance to range -- to a range of 310 Bcfe to 335 Bcfe, a 2.5 Bcfe increase at the midpoint.
National Fuel's first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.85 per share when you back out items impacting comparability, including a ceiling test charge and the impact of a gain related to the sale of our timber properties, operating results were $1.06 per share.
John and Dave hit the high points in our Upstream and Pipeline businesses, so let me touch briefly on earnings at the Utility, which were down $3.5 million versus last year's first quarter.
National Fuel's first quarter was a great start to our fiscal year, with operating results up 5% year-over-year.
We are maintaining our fiscal '21 capex guidance, which remains in the $350 million to $390 million range.
Operationally, we had a really strong quarter, particularly at Seneca and NFG Midstream, where in spite of 4 Bcf of pricing-related curtailments, production and the associated gathering throughput was up 36% over last year.
We produced a Company record, 79.5 Bcfe, despite approximately 4 Bcf of price-related curtailments in October and early November.
Looking out beyond the current year, the fiscal '22 strip is around $2.80 an Mcf, a price where we realized strong returns from our Appalachia program.
These are expected to be somewhat offset by revisions to our commodity price assumptions for the remaining nine months of the year, with our NYMEX natural gas guidance decreasing to $2.75 per MMBtu and WTI guidance increasing to $52.50 per barrel.
Although pricing in fiscal '21 has not been as strong as we initially projected during this winter, the supply and demand fundamentals, whether notwithstanding, remain constructive over the next 12 to 18 months.
As always, we have maintained our disciplined approach to hedging and are already well positioned in fiscal '22, with over 180 Bcf of fixed price firm sales, NYMEX swaps and costless collars in place.
Switching gears, our FERC-regulated pipeline businesses had a great quarter, with earnings up nearly 25%.
As you can see from our updated slide deck at a $2.75 NYMEX price, we expect our Upstream and Gathering businesses will generate approximately $115 million to $125 million in free cash flow in 2021.
Additionally, we achieved between $300,000 to $500,000 per well in reduced water cost on our recent Tioga 007 pad completions through the use of acquired water withdrawal points and storage facilities.
With respect to consolidated capital spending, all of our segment ranges remain the same, and we are still projecting between $720 million and $830 million for the fiscal year.
