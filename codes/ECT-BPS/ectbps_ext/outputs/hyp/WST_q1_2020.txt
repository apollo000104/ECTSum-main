We expect our full-year 2020 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62, compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%.
Full-year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion.
Estimated FX headwind on earnings per share has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, compared to prior guidance of $0.04.
We recorded $167 million in gross profit, $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year, and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90-basis point expansion from the same period last year.
The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 earnings per share impact from our first-quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
We recorded net sales of $491.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth.
Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase.
Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million.
We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales.
Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020, was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents.
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180-basis point increase from the same period last year.
Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 36% for Q1.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter, strong top-line growth in both Proprietary and contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter, compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase.
