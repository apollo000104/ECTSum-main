On a per share basis, second quarter earnings were $4.09 compared to earnings per share of $0.43 last year and earnings per share of $0.55 for the second quarter of 2019.
On a non-GAAP basis, earnings were $2.21 per share, up over 200% compared to earnings per share of $0.71 for the second quarter of last year and compared to earnings per share of $0.66 for the second quarter of 2019.
We expect our non-GAAP earnings range to be approximately $7 to $7.15 per share.
During the second quarter of 2021, the company recorded adjustments to earnings, including $303 million of noncash gains related to our minority investments, of which $290 million was related to a higher valuation for the company's investment in GOAT and a $39 million charge was due primarily to the impairment review of Footaction.
We anticipate that accretion on an annualized basis will be in the range of $0.44 to $0.48 in 2022.
Along with this strong demand, our focus on more full-price selling, combined with our disciplined expense management, yielded non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.21, an increase of over 200%.
We delivered a 6.9% comp gain on top of the 18.6% gain in the second quarter of last year.
For the full year, we now expect to open approximately 120 stores, remodel or relocate 165 and close 345.
Our digital sales penetration rate was 20.1%, normalizing from the peak levels we saw in 2020 while remaining well above 2019 levels, a trend we expect to continue going forward.
For the second quarter, our global fleet was open for approximately 94% of possible operating days with temporary closures in Canada, certain markets in Asia and Germany.
In terms of depreciation and amortization expense, we expect it to be approximately $185 million to $190 million.
And we have approximately 50 more conversions planned for the back half of the year, along with 130 Footaction store closures.
Lastly, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 28.5%.
More specifically, in 2022, we expect that we will begin to generate approximately $10 million in annualized cost synergies by leveraging our supply chain and operating capabilities.
We also closed 57 stores in the quarter, primarily in the U.S., leaving us with 2,911 company-owned stores at the end of Q2.
But even with the decline in operating days, we saw a 30% comp increase in our Asia markets and a mid-single-digit gain in the Pacific region.
