Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, yielding total liquidity of $4.7 billion at quarter end, up approximately $2 billion from Q1 as we received the gross proceeds from both divestitures in Q2.
Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 48% and 25%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment.
The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $292 million, a year-over-year improvement of $75 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%, a 160 basis point improvement year-over-year.
We have launched aggressive 2030 and 2050 goals and improve our new product development process to address these goals.
Overall, organic orders were up 41% and revenue up 17%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.15.
Finally, corporate costs came in at $38 million for the quarter, up year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation and other targeted strategic investments.
Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.14 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 0.96.
With these two acquisitions, we're expecting to add approximately $3.8 billion to PST addressable market, which is an impressive 40% expansion.
This takes our net leverage to 0.2 times, a 1.7 times improvement from Q1.
Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are reaffirming our stated $300 million cost savings target.
And we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing as organic orders in Q2 were up 9% and 6% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, as compared to 2019.
We have focus and deliver on diversity within our Board and extended leadership team, which is now 50% and 43%, respectively.
We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% up to $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023.
The company delivered $292 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of 34% versus prior year.
At its current state, the funnel size remains approximately 5 times the size it was versus Q2 of 2020, with average revenue larger and velocity accelerating minutely.
Our $85 per share offer was pre-emptive, and fully accounted for SPX Flow's Investor Day plan, which is ahead of consensus estimates.
