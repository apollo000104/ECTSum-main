Adjusted EBITDA totaled $741 million thus far in 2021, compared to $261 million for the first nine months of 2020.
I'm also pleased to announce that yesterday, our board of directors authorized a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend, which now annualizes to $0.96 per share.
I'm very pleased with our strong third quarter results, which saw EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA increased over 165% compared to Q3 of 2020 and the record results we have posted for the first nine months of the year.
As I mentioned on the last call, we have a clear path to grow our stabilized NOI at the rate of 10% to 15% a year over the next three years, driven by strong organic NOI growth, new acquisitions, and the completion of our construction.
Adjusted net income in the quarter grew to $112 million, compared to $27 million last year.
For the year, we've had GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 per share, adjusted net income of $424 million, and as Bill mentioned, adjusted EBITDA of $741 million, representing record results for the first nine months of the year.
Our Q3 transactions grew estimated annual NOI to $413 million, an increase of $19 million in the year, and we increased our fee-bearing capital to $4.8 billion, representing a 23% growth year to date.
We also plan to grow our fee-bearing capital and resulting fees by 15% to 20% per year over the next three years.
Turning to our investment management platform, we continued to see strong growth in the quarter, with our fee-bearing capital growing to $4.8 billion.
Since the beginning of 2018, we've now returned $750 million, or approximately $5.40 per share, to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases, which includes repurchasing 15.7, million shares or approximately 10%, of our outstanding share count.
Global transaction volumes remain healthy, with Q3 volumes in the U.S. increasing 150% from last year's levels, according to Real Capital Analytics.
We're on track to increase our global unit count to 35,000 by year-end.
We have significantly improved our maturity schedule, with no unsecured debt maturities until 2025 and nothing outstanding on our $500 million revolving credit facility.
We also saw significant improvements in our Pacific Northwest and California portfolio, as pandemic-related moratoriums began to burn off, and we expect meaningful rent growth in all of these areas over the next 15 months.
Our assets under management has grown by 17% in 2021 to a record $20.5 billion, from $17.6 billion at the end of 2020.
