Income from operations to a $60.2 million, down 18%, reflecting the lower revenue and gross profit.
Revenues came in at $710 million, down 18% from prior year, with the bulk of that decline in our Safety-Kleen segment.
EPS was $0.52 in Q2 versus $0.65 a year ago.
We now expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $470 million to $500 million.
Safety-Kleen revenue was down 30% due to a slowdown in both the branch and the SK Oil businesses, due to customer shutdowns.
Participants are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of today, August 5, 2020.
For 2020, we expect depreciation and amortization in the range of $285 million to $295 million, which is slightly below last year.
Our incineration utilization increased to 87% due to our healthy backlog coming into the quarter and steady streams from chemical customers.
As Alan highlighted, our EBITDA declined less than $15 million from a year ago, despite revenues being $159 million lower.
Leverage on a net debt basis now sits at 2.1 times for the trailing 12 months ended June 30th, which puts us in an excellent position financially.
For Safety-Kleen, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to decline approximately 20% from 2019's $282 million.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.1%, which speaks to how effectively we reduced costs, managed overtime, closed rerefineries and locations and furloughed workers as needed.
As expected, depreciation and amortization in Q2 was down slightly to $72.5 million with only one small bolt-on acquisition in the trailing 12 months, we should continue to see this trend going forward.
Our landfill volumes were down 24%, due to the deferral of some remediation and waste projects, but our base business remained stable, which drove our average price per ton, up 15% from a year ago.
Growth and profitability within incineration, contributions from the expected $100 million in decontamination work and comprehensive cost reduction initiatives will offset declines in profitability within industrial services, landfills, remediations, waste projects and other lines of business.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 41% due to the lower revenue, pricing for our SK Oil products and costs associated with the temporary shuttering of our refineries, partly offset by cost reduction efforts and government assistance programs which totaled $8.3 million dollars for this segment in Q2.
