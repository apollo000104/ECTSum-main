As Jay mentioned today, we increased our 2021 core FFO per share guidance from the range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
Given our strong start to the year, we're pleased to announce an increase in our guidance for 2021 core FFO by approximately 6% from a range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
That's up $0.06 from the preceding fourth quarter $0.63 and down $0.01 from the prior year's $0.70 per share.
Today, we also reported that AFFO per share was $0.76 per share for the first quarter, which is $0.07 per share higher than the preceding fourth quarter $0.69.
So these two items, totaling approximately $5 million, added just under $0.03 per share to our results.
So improving to 80% added about $4 million of revenues in the first quarter versus our prior guidance.
Our portfolio of 3,161 freestanding single-tenant retail properties continued to perform exceedingly well.
Results for the first quarter included two nonrecurring type items totaling $5 million.
As Jay mentioned, we reported today rent collections of approximately 97% for the first quarter, 98% for April rent collection.
During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured 30-year interest-only bonds at a rate of 3.5%.
So we ended the first quarter with $311 million of cash in the bank, a 0 balance on our $900 million line of credit, no material debt maturities until 2024 and an average debt duration of over 13 years.
For context, full year 2020 was $2 million of lease termination fee income.
Notably, we only forgave 0.1% of our first quarter rents.
First, we collected $2.2 million of receivables from cash basis tenants that relate to prior quarters.
Although we continue to be prudent in our underwriting, we acquired 29 new properties in the quarter for just under $106 million, at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with an average lease duration of 17.5 years.
Most notable collections from our cash basis tenants, which represent approximately $50 million or 7% of our annual base rent, improved to approximately 80% for the first quarter.
