Earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143%, 108% if you exclude the onetime tax benefit of $0.35 that we recorded in the quarter.
We are raising our GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.35 to a range of $8.55 to $8.95 to incorporate the onetime tax benefit realized in the second quarter.
GAAP earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.35 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there.

We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion, up 15% at the midpoint versus last year, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and foreign currency translation impact of plus 3%.
Revenue was up 43% with organic growth up 37%, and we saw double-digit growth in every segment and geography.
Given the ongoing semiconductor chip supply uncertainty, we now expect full year organic growth in Automotive to be approximately 10% versus our original range of 14% to 18% at the beginning of the year.
Finally, we expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23% to 24% and for a full year tax rate of around 20%.
The midpoint of $8.75 represents earnings growth of 32% versus last year and 13% over 2019.
For the full year, we expect price/cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of Q1.
Institutional revenue was up more than 30%, with healthcare and education growth in the low to mid-30s and lodging up in the mid-20s.
By geography, North America was up 36% and international was up 38%, with Europe up 50% and Asia Pacific up 20%.
We estimate that the shortage of semiconductor chips negatively impacted our sales by about $60 million in the quarter.
In Q2, we ended up just short of that goal due to some timing lags, and as a result, net price/cost impact reduced earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter.
Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue of $606 million was a Q2 record with organic growth of 29%.
Price/cost with a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the longer cycle time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment.
