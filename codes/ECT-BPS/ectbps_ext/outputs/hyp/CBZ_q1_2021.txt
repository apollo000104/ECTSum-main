We are pleased to report 390 basis point margin expansion on pre-tax income, leading to a 39.4% increase in earnings per share, up to $0.92 per share this year compared with $0.66 in the first quarter a year ago.
As a result of this repurchase activity, we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count for 2021 within a range of 54 million to 54.5 million shares, which represents a slight reduction in our full year expectation compared with guidance earlier this year, and we will provide further updates as we progress through the year.
Since the end of the quarter through April 27, we have purchased approximately 270,000 additional shares under a 10b program for a total of approximately 1.4 million shares repurchased this year to date.
Our revised guidance is to grow revenue between 8% to 10% and earnings per share within a range of 12% to 15% for the full year of 2021 compared to the full year of 2020.
Future earn-out payments are estimated at approximately $11.8 million for the balance of this year, $16.1 million next year in 2022, approximately $9.7 million in 2023, approximately $13.5 million in 2024, and $800,000 in 2025.
In the first quarter, we used $3.7 million for acquisitions, including earn-out payments on acquisitions closed in previous years.
Also, as a reminder, in the first quarter a year ago, we recorded an additional $2 million of bad debt expense.
With total revenue growing by 8.4% in the first quarter, revenue growth from acquired businesses accounted for 4.8% of that growth, with same unit growth up by 3.6%.
To put this in context, the total revenue from this segment of our payroll clients represents less than 4% of CBIZ' total revenues.
But after reporting a same unit revenue decline of 3% for the full year last year, the 1.6% first quarter same unit revenue growth within benefits insurance this year is noteworthy.
Turning to the benefits and insurance group, total revenue grew by 9.6%, with same unit revenue growth of 1.6% in the first quarter this year.
In the first quarter, we used approximately $32.7 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares.
Our Financial Services group recorded total revenue growth of 8.1%, with same unit revenue growth of 4.5%.
This impacts our reported gross margin, which was 27.1% on an adjusted basis this year compared to 22.6% a year ago.
And operating margin on an adjusted basis was 22.4% compared with 18.2% a year ago.
These attributes include the proportion, representing approximately 70% of our revenue that comes from essential and recurring services, including our tax services, insurance services, payroll services and a host of others that our clients rely on us to provide regardless of business conditions.
