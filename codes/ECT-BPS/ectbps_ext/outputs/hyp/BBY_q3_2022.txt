Today, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to two years ago.
We expect the following: enterprise revenue in the range of $51.8 billion to $52.3 billion compared to our previous guide of $51 billion to $52 billion, comparable sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our previous guide of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year.
Compared to last year, enterprise revenue grew $57 million, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 increased $0.02, a lower share count resulted in a $0.12 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis.
We expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year.
And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year.
Compared to our guidance, enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion exceeded the high end of our revenue outlook of $11.6 billion, driven by the better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 1.6%.
After delivering significant growth for the past several quarters and lapping a 46% comp in the third quarter of last year, computing comparable sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis but still up nearly $1 billion from two years ago.
With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $1.7 billion, we still expect to spend more than $2.5 billion in share repurchases this year.
For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9.5%, which compares to our prior outlook of 9%.
In our International segment, revenue decreased 7.8% to $925 million.
In our domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to almost $11 billion.
In addition, our services comparable sales declined 5.6% this quarter.
From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to increase approximately 8% compared to last year.
Despite lapping the extraordinary 23% comparable sales growth from last year, we were once again able to generate positive comparable sales growth in each fiscal month of the third quarter.
From a profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate due to the estimated impact of our new Totaltech offer, which we expect to be partially offset by a more favorable product mix.
As a result of the higher revenue and our ability to adjust to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 160 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from two years ago.
