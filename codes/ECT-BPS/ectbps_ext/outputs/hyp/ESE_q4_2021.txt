All these items delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 per share above prior year's $0.80 per share.
We have seen some good trends developing with orders and are excited to issue guidance that calls for earnings per share in the range of $310 million to $320 million or growth of 20% to 24% in fiscal '22.
USG saw sales growth of 16% in the quarter.
Below the EBIT line, we saw interest expense of approximately $800,000 in the quarter compared to nearly $1.5 million in the prior year Q4.
This earnings per share range assumes '22 sales in the range of $810 million to $830 million or growth of 13% to 16%.
The A&D Group had a full year sales decline of 11%, the main driver of the sales drop was commercial aerospace, which was down 29% for the year, this was somewhat offset by 4% increase from the Navy business.
A&D did see sales weakness in the quarter as previously mentioned, the group was down 16%, in the quarter we saw declines in all major markets with commercial aerospace down 15%, space down 10% and the Navy business down 27%.
We expect A&D to grow sales in the range of 10% to 12%, USG to grow in the range of 28% to 32% and test to grow 3% to 5%.
Sales in the fourth quarter were flat to prior year Q4 with A&D down 16%, USG was up 16% and Test grew 11%.
If you exclude the impact of the Q4 acquisitions, the growth was approximately 8%.
Our Test business has seen a nice pickup in its overall piece of business, we had double-digit sales growth there in Q4, and we also saw order growth of over 30%, some exciting numbers.
USG at a full-year sales increase of 6% excluding the fourth quarter acquisitions the growth was 4% and this was driven by 29% growth at NRG.
The energy business grew 25% for the full year and the fourth quarter was consistent with that as well.
Adjusted EBIT margins were 13.7% in the quarter compared to 13.9% in the prior year quarter.
We saw good orders for USG in Q4 and including the recent acquisitions we move into fiscal '22 with a record backlog position of $92 million.
We do have some headwinds next year with increased interest expense to $4 million in a projected tax rate of 23% to 24%, but the plan still deliver strong earnings per share in spite of these items.
