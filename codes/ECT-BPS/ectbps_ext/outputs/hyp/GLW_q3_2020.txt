This resulted in net income of $380 million and earnings per share of $0.43, up 72% sequentially.
Sales were $3 billion, up 16% sequentially.
EPS grew 72% sequentially to $0.43, as higher sales and strong manufacturing execution resulted in operating margin expanding to 18.3%, up 710 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year.
Now, looking at the third quarter, we grew 16% -- sales grew 16% sequentially to $3 billion, and our operating margin expanded by 710 basis points sequentially, to 18.3%.
In display technologies, third quarter sales were $827 million, up 10% sequentially, and net income was $196 million, up 29% sequentially.
In the third quarter, we recognized $31 million of sales from the newly consolidated Hemlock.
And Hemlock will add approximately $150 million in annual cash flow.
Automotive sales increased 1% year-over-year as continued strong adoption of GPS helped us exceed vehicle production, which declined 6% year over year.
In optical communications, third-quarter sales grew 10% sequentially to $909 million, as carrier spending and deployments remain stable and enterprise sales grew slightly.
We effectively adjusted our operations to pace with the market recovery and delivered net income of $69 million, compared to breakeven in the second quarter.
From 2016 to 2019, we added $500 million in sales, or 42% cumulatively, while smartphone sales actually went down.
Net income grew by $34 million or 42% to $115 million, driven by improving cost performance.
Environmental technology sales in the third quarter were $379 million, up 68% sequentially as markets recovered and OEMs continued to adopt GPS in Europe and China.
And we, again, saw outperformance this quarter with sequential sales up 68%.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce cost, control inventory and execute well overall.
We are clearly seeing the benefits of this lever in today's results as innovation adoption drove specialty materials sales up 23% year-over-year despite a declining smartphone market.
