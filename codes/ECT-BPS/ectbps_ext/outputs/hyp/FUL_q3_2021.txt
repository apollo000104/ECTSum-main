We also reported adjusted EBITDA of $111 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.79.
Last evening, we announced strong third quarter results led by 20% year-over-year revenue growth.
Regarding our outlook, based on what we know today, we now expect fourth quarter revenue growth to be between 15% and 17%.
Organic revenue was up 16% versus 2020 and was up 13% versus the pre-COVID-19 environment in the third quarter of 2019.
We are narrowing our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $460 million to $470 million, given our expectations for continued strong volume growth and accelerated pricing, offsetting raw material cost increases that we now expect to exceed 15% for the full year.
Adjusted gross profit was up 3.8% year-on-year but gross profit margin was down as volume growth and pricing gains were more than offset by higher raw material costs.
Overall, when considering our strategic pricing actions coupled with the solid volume growth in HHC, continued improving performance in Construction Adhesives and strong demand in Engineering Adhesives, we now expect full-year revenue growth of 17% to 18% versus 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $111 million was up 5% versus the same period last year and adjusted earnings per share were $0.79, up 4% versus the third quarter of last year, driven by strong volume growth, pricing gains and good cost controls offset by higher raw material cost.
This would represent full year EBITDA growth in the range of 13% to 16%.
Through the third quarter, we have implemented $225 million of price adjustments and we took the decisive step of announcing a September 1st increase and surcharge in order to offset further raw material cost increases.
On pricing, we moved quickly to implement $225 million in pricing actions, which are aligned with the value customers derived from our adhesives.
When compared to Q3 2019, organic revenue increased 13.1% for the total company with strong organic growth for all three GBUs.
Adjusting for currency, organic revenue was up 16.4% with volume up 10.1% and pricing up 6.3%.
All three GBUs had double-digit organic growth versus 2020 with Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives up over 19% year-on-year and HHC up 13%.
We expect cash flow to be strong for the rest of the year, allowing us to maintain our target to pay down approximately $200 million of debt during 2021.
These actions are expected to result in more than $400 million of pricing revenue on an annualized basis.
