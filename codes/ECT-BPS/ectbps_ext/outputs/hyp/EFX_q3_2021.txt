We're expecting adjusted earnings per share in 4Q 2021 to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share compared to 4Q 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $2 per share.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.85 a share was down slightly from last year.
We expect revenue in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 10% to 11.8%, including a 0.1% benefit from FX.
Adjusting for the cloud transformation costs of $45 million or $0.27 a share, adjusted earnings per share would have been up a strong 11%.
Given our very strong third quarter performance, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance by approximately 320 basis points or $131 million, at the midpoint of a range between $4.9 billion to $4.921 billion, up 19% from last year, and increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.22 per share to a midpoint of $7.57 per share, which adjusting for technology transformation cost implies a 23% growth in EPS.
Excluding these costs, which were excluded from 4Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 4Q 2021 adjusted earnings per share would be $1.99 to $2.09 per share.
We had a very strong third quarter and first nine months of 2021, a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of $1.223 billion, which was up over 14% with core non-mortgage market and non-UC ERC claims revenue growth of 20%.
Revenue at $1.22 billion was up 14.5% with organic constant currency growth of a strong 12%.
Slide 21 provides an adjusted earnings per share walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 14% growth from the midpoint of the 2021 guidance of $7.57 per share to the midpoint of our 2022 framework of $8.65 per share.
Our revenue growth has accelerated from 3% in 2019 as we were recovering from the 2017 cyber event and investing heavily in our EFX cloud transformation to 17% last year.
In the quarter, we released 30 new products and we still expect our Vitality Index to accelerate from 5% last year to over 8% in 2021.
In 4Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $45 million or $0.27 per share.
For 2022, based on trends we are seeing in new purchase and refinance that I will discuss shortly, our 2022 framework assumes the U.S. mortgage market as measured by total credit market inquiries will decline about 15% from 2021.
Excluding the impact of tech transformation cost of $1.01 per share, adjusted earnings per share in 2021 would show growth of about 22% to 24% versus 2020.
These costs related to cloud tech transformation negatively impacted EBITDA margins by almost 500 basis points.
2021 adjusted earnings per share of $7.52 to $7.62 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is up 7.8% to 9.3% from 2020.
