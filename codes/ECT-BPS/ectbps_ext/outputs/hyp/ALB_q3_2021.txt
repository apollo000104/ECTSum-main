Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share was $1.05 for the quarter, down 4% from the prior year.
We reported another solid quarter with net sales of $831 million and adjusted EBITDA of $218 million.
During the third quarter, we generated net sales of $831 million, an 11% increase from the same period last year.
The GAAP net loss of $393 million includes a $505 million after-tax charge related to the recently announced Huntsman arbitration decision.
Sales improved by 11% on a year-over-year basis, while adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat compared to the third quarter last year.
Following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of next year, we plan to make additional investments to bring Qinzhou plant to Albemarle standards and ramp to initial production of 25,000 metric tons.
At the end of September, we announced an agreement to acquire Tianyuan for $200 million, including a recently built conversion plant near the port of Qinzhou designed to produce up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium per year with the potential to expand to 50,000 metric tons per year.
Excluding FCS from our third quarter 2020 results, our net sales were 19% higher and EBITDA was up 14%.
Catalyst full year 2021 EBITDA is now expected to decline between 20% and 25%.
We plan to build identical conversion plants with initial target production of 50,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide at each site.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $218 million increased by 14% or $27 million compared to the prior year, excluding the sale of FCS.
These projects position us for initial added conversion capacity of up to 150,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide on an annual basis to meet our customers' growing demands.
Initially, Wodgina will begin one of three processing lines, each of which can produce up to 250,000 metric tons of lithium spodumene concentrate.
In total, we expect EBITDA margins to be lower in the fourth quarter due to higher raw materials, energy and freight costs across all 3 of our businesses.
In addition to this plant, we have signed two recent agreements for investments in China to support two greenfield projects, each initially targeting 50,000 metric tons per year.
Full year 2021 average margins are expected to remain below 35% due to higher costs related to the project start-ups and tolling partially offset by productivity improvements.
