For the third and fourth quarters we are establishing ranges for FFO per share guidance as adjusted for comparability of $0.54 to $0.56 and $0.56 to $0.58 respectively.
Second quarter FFO per share as adjusted for comparability of $0.58 exceeded the high end of guidance by a $0.01.
Second quarter FFO per share as adjusted for comparability of $0.58 exceeded the high end of guidance by $0.01 driven primarily by stronger same property results.
Lastly, and for reasons already discussed, we are increasing our full year guidance from a previously elevated range of $2.19 to $2.25 to a new range of $2.24 to $2.28.
Our updated guidance range implies 5.7% to 7.5% growth over 2020 results and 6.6% at the midpoint.
Additionally, NOI from real estate operations in the quarter was up 8% and AFFO increased 17% from a year ago.
Based on the 1.8 million square feet of opportunities in our development leasing pipeline, we are highly confident we will meet our 2021 development leasing goal.
We expect to deliver NoVA C in 610 Guardian Way earlier than planned, which combined with Project EL are adding nearly $0.03 to this year's FFO per share.
The $2.26 midpoint of updated 2021 guidance is $0.07 above our original midpoint and 6.6% higher than 2020 results.
The $0.55 midpoint in the third quarter reflects a full quarter's dilution from the two data center shells we joint ventured in June and executing additional R&M projects.
Based on this activity we're highly confident we will achieve our 1 million square foot growth for the year.
Regarding our large renewal at DC-6, we have not finalized the lease yet.
During the quarter, we placed 197,000 square feet of development projects in the service including Project EL, 107,000 square foot specialized facility we built for a defense contractor in San Antonio.
Lastly, we are in advanced negotiations with a defense contractor for a two-building campus at Redstone Gateway for 250,000 square feet.
These leases would bring our total development leasing for the year to 950,000 square feet.
Including three properties under development, we wholly own 10 data center shells that we estimate represent more than $750 million of equity value we can monetize to fund the equity component of future development.
