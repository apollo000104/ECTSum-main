For the second quarter Western Alliance earned total net revenues of $506.5 million, net income before merger and restructuring charges of $236.5 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.29, an increase of 20.5% from the prior quarter.
Tangible book value per share modestly declined to $32.86 from $33.2 as goodwill and intangibles doubled to $611 million in Q2 mainly from recognizing the AMH platform value.
For the quarter, Western Alliance generated adjusted net income of $236 million or $229 million adjusted earnings per share up 22.9% and 20.5% from the prior quarter.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.25 per share our tangible book value per share declined $0.16 for the quarter to $0.3286 compared to an increase of 18% over the past 12 months.
We continue to believe we will exit the year at a $9 earnings per share run rate level.
Finally tangible book value per share decreased $0.16 over the prior quarter to $0.3286 but increased 18% year-over-year again driven by the AmeriHome acquisition of intangible assets that were largely offset by Q2 earnings and the issuance of common stock from our ATM of 700,000 shares for $70 million.
Given the flexibility of AmeriHome's business model, we continue to stand by our full-year guidance of $1.41.
Net interest income totaled $370.5 million up $53.2 million or 16.8% for the quarter as robust balance sheet growth rising NIM and access liquidity deployment significantly moves the earnings needle.
Despite the evolving mortgage sector fundamentals AmeriHome continues to meet our expectations and contributed $0.39 to earnings per share in Q2.
Additionally, pre-provision net revenue of $277 million rose 37% quarter over quarter, excluding those same charges.
So, for the second half of the year I think you can expect loan and deposits to continue to grow between $1 billion and $1.5 billion per quarter.
These results benefited from a $14.5 million reversal of credit loss provision consistent with our excellent asset quality results.
After the AmeriHome acquisition, total net revenue grew $169.5 million during the quarter to $506.5 million, an increase of over 50% from the prior quarter.
As a result net interest income grew $53.2 million to $370.5 million during the quarter or 24% year-over-year as average earning assets increased $4.1 billion.
Gain on sale margin was 64 basis points for the quarter in line with 2019, 63 basis points.
It excludes pre-merger -- pre-tax merger and restructuring expenses of $15.7 million related to AmeriHome.
