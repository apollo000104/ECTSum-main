Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q2 is $0.67 to $0.71 per share.
Normalized funds from operations in the first quarter was $0.72 per share, a $0.01 beat versus the high end of our prior guidance range of $0.66 to $0.71.
Second quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.07 per fully diluted share.
Ventas reported first quarter net income of minus $0.15 per share, driven by noncash charges in the quarter as we transferred assets to held for sale.
Adjusted for these grants, Q1 FFO per share was $0.68.
Construction starts continued to decelerate in the first quarter to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2011, and were down 77% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Core office grew 1.7% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially.
The Q2 FFO midpoint of $0.69 is $0.01 higher sequentially than the first quarter results due to an improving SHOP trajectory, after adjusting for HHS Grants in both periods.
As a result, same-store SHOP NOI declined sequentially by 8% in the second quarter versus the first.
IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.7 times in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding.
As previously communicated and included in our Q1 guidance range, we received $0.04 in HHS Grants in SHOP in Q1.
Since then, led by our U.S. SHOP community, which posted 280 basis points of growth, we grew SHOP spot occupancy 190 basis points through April 30th to nearly 78%.
All-in, the office portfolio delivered $123 million of same-store cash NOI in the first quarter.
As Debbie noted, we are pleased with the improvement in leading indicators in occupancy as our move-in and move-out performance in March and April resulted in 266 and 363 net move-ins, respectively.
The 80-plus population is expected to grow 17% over the next five years, more than double the rate witnessed during the five-year recovery following the financial crisis.
The result is that MOB occupancy stayed essentially flat, down only 10 basis points for the quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year.
