As planned, we invested $259 million of capital in the quarter and expect Q3 to trend lower with a further decrease in Q4.
In Southwest Appalachia, we brought online our first Ohio Utica dry gas pad and achieved our $100 per foot cost reduction goal with an average well cost of $728 per foot.
Costs on wells to sales were in line with the first quarter at $626 per foot with an average lateral length of approximately 14,000 feet.
The expansion in the Haynesville adds Tier-1 dry gas inventory locations that complement our existing Appalachia inventory.
This included 2.4 Bcf per day of gas representing 79% of total production and approximately 104,000 barrels per day of oil and NGLs flat to the first quarter and consistent with our maintenance capital program.
Total production was 276 Bcfe or 3 Bcfe per day.
The shareholder vote is set for August 27 and we expect to close shortly thereafter.
We brought 31 wells to sales in the quarter, drilled 23 and completed 19.
This three well pad had an average lateral length of approximately 13,700 feet and an average 30-day rate of 25 million cubic feet per day, all performing in line with expectations.
We have a unique combination of a strong balance sheet, large scale Tier-1 operated assets, proven execution and ESG performance providing the means to deliver sustainable value creation.
The solid quarterly financial results further improved our leverage ratio by almost half turn to 2.6 times.
Liquidity remains in good shape with just under $570 million in borrowings and $1.2 billion of capacity on a credit facility.
These wells had an average 30-day rate of 14 million cubic feet per day.
We placed 11 wells to sales in the quarter with an average well cost of $531 per foot at an average lateral length of approximately 11,600 feet.
