Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.03 to $3.11, while adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.84 to $3.39.
As such, we now expect fiscal '22 revenue to be in the range of $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion.
Due to the health of our business and our outlook, we announced today an increase in our quarterly dividend of 4% to $0.27 per share.
As a result, pre-tax income was $669 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $3 million in the prior year.
We saw a slight share loss as we focused on more valuable returns, evidenced by our improved mix and an increase in NAC of over 20%.
Our net average charge was down about 2% due entirely to mix as the majority of growth in new clients came from filers at lower price points.
This normalized view of fiscal '21 ending June 30 would result in an estimated revenue of $3.25 billion and EBITDA of $760 million.
And third, Wave continued exceptional growth of over 35% for the year, while also expanding Wave Money as the center of the experience.
Our effective tax rate was just 12%, driven by favorable tax planning we implemented during the year.
Regarding our outlook, the effective tax rate is anticipated to be between 16% and 18%, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be between $150 million and 160 million, and interest expense is anticipated to be between $90 million and $100 million.
Moving to our DIY business, revenue grew nearly 20% due to an increase in the net average charge related to improved mix and pricing actions.
EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $765 million to $815 million.
Total operating expenses were $2.6 billion, which increased by $82 million or 3% due to an increase in variable labor, which is partially offset by prior-year impairment charges, lower bank partner fees, and travel-related costs.
Regarding share repurchases, we bought a total of $38 million in the fourth quarter.
This all led to revenue growth of over 35%.
This marks the fifth time we've raised the dividend in six years, resulting in a 35% total increase over that time.
