GAAP earnings per share were $1.68.
Adjusted for the loss recovery, as well as restructuring and other charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.42.
Excluding the 20.8 million loss recovery and associated legal fees, as well as restructuring charges during the quarter of 1.3 million, our adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, down 70 basis points from the prior year.
I would also note that we repurchased 47 million of stock during the quarter or about 507,000 shares at an average price of 92.92 per share.
Sales of safety and janitorial products, as expected, given the significant surge during the pandemic last year, declined just over 40% for the quarter.
Revenues were up 2.2% on an average daily sales basis as we're seeing continued sequential improvement in our sales levels.
Furthermore, and as Erik mentioned earlier, we expect to achieve 20% or higher incremental margins in both fiscal '22 and fiscal 2023.
Our third-quarter sales were 866 million, up 3.8% versus the same quarter last year.
Our gross margin for fiscal Q3 was 42.3%, up 30 basis points sequentially after adjusting our inventory writedown from last quarter and down just 10 basis points from last year.
Operating expenses in the third quarter were 257.3 million or 29.7% of sales versus 242.8 million or 29.1% of sales in the prior year.
And we shared with you two goals that underpin our efforts: first, to accelerate market share capture with a target growth rate of at least 400 basis points above IP by the end of our fiscal 2023; second, to return ROIC into the high teens powered not only by leveraging growth, but also by structural cost takeout of 90 to $100 million also by the end of fiscal 2023.
So on an average daily sales basis, net sales increased 2.2%.
Most notably, non-safety and non-janitorial product lines improved through the quarter from mid-single-digit declines in our second quarter to 21% growth in our third quarter.
Our free cash flow was 3 million in the third quarter, as compared to 49 million in the prior year.
Given the success of the program through the first three quarters, we now expect to achieve savings for fiscal 2021 of roughly 40 million.
Our non-safety and non-janitorial growth is estimated at roughly 20%, while safety and janitorial are estimated to be down roughly 10% against last year's continued PPE surge.
