We reported GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter.
Net income to common shareholders was $37.6 million or $0.08 per share.
On the other hand, fourth-quarter earnings were reduced by expenses related to the acceleration of discount in connection with our payoff of the $500 million, 11% Apollo/Athene senior note in September and October.
After the initial significant increase in CECL reserves taken in Q1 and uncertainty related to COVID-19 economic impacts were at the highest, we have reduced our CECL reserves by almost $60 million in the past three quarters.
With two 10s at approximately 125 basis points, this hardly qualifies as a steep yield curve by historical standards, but it has steepened by about 45 basis points since the end of the year.
The yield curve does continue to surreptitiously steepen as the 10-year backed up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter and another almost 45 since year end.
Also, we reduced our overall CECL allowance in our current value loans to $86.8 million, primarily reflecting lower estimates of future unemployment used for credit loss modeling purposes, but also partially due to lower loan balances.

Net income includes $25.3 million or $0.06 per common share of expenses recognized on the repayment of the senior secured term loan from Apollo/Athene.
This reversal and other net adjustments to our CECL reserves positively impacted net income for the quarter by approximately $16 million.
Economic book value also negatively impacted by 3.9% by the warrants was nevertheless unchanged at $4.92 during the fourth quarter as our loans held at carrying value appreciated further.
I would also note that since exiting forbearance in June, we have lowered our cost of funds across our entire portfolio by 140 basis points to 3.1% December 31, 2020, and this falls even further to 2.9% with the senior note redemption.
Net gains of $49.8 million were recorded, including $30.9 million of market value increases and $18.9 million of interest payments, liquidation gains, and other cash income.
This transaction lowers the funding rate of the underlying asset by over 150 basis points and increases the percentage of SFR financing that is non mark to market to 77%, up 54% from 23% at the end of the fourth quarter.
We announced on our third-quarter earnings call that our board had authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program and we executed this during the open-window period in the fourth quarter by purchasing 14.1 million shares at an average price of $3.61, which was accretive to GAAP and economic book value by $0.03 and $0.04, respectively.
Obviously, our GAAP book value would have been up by approximately 2.4% for the quarter had it not been for these warrants.
