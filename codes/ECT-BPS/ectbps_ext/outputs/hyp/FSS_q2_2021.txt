Assuming no significant delays in our receipt of chassis from our supplier, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a new range of $1.78 to $1.9 from the prior range of $1.73 to $1.85.
On this basis, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $0.50 per share compared with $0.42 per share last year.
On an overall GAAP basis, we therefore earned $0.48 per share in Q2 this year compared with $0.35 per share in Q2 last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.50 per share, an improvement of 19% compared to $0.42 per share last year.
That equates to GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $0.48 per share, up 37% from $0.35 per share last year.
Net income for the quarter was $29.7 million, up from $21.4 million last year.
Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $335 million, up $65 million or 24% compared to last year.
In Q2 this year, the return of many of these costs represented a year-over-year expense headwind of approximately $5 million.
At this time, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 23%.
Looking now at cash flow, where we generated $13 million of cash from operations during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date operating cash generation to $39 million.
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $38.5 million, up $7.2 million or 23% compared to last year.
Demand for our products continues to be high with our second quarter order intake, up 79% compared to the prior year, resulting in a backlog entering the second half of the year, which is at a record level.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $51.9 million, up $6.5 million or 14% compared to last year.
For the rest of the year, we are expecting strong cash flow generation, and we continue to target cash conversion of approximately 100% on a net income basis.
As a reminder, in the prior year quarter, we also took several cost saving actions in response to the uncertainty created by the pandemic, which reduced our costs in Q2 last year by approximately $14 million.
On that note, we paid dividends of $5.5 million during the quarter, reflecting a dividend of $0.09 per share, and we recently announced a similar dividend for the third quarter.
