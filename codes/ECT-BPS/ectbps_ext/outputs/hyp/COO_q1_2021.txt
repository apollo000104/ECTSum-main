Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $12.90 to $13.10.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.17.
The guidance includes consolidated revenues of 2.8 to 2.845 billion, up 15 to 17%, or up 12 to 14% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues of 2.090 to 2.120 billion, up 13 to 15%, or up 9 to 11% and in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues of 710 to 725 million, up 21 to 23%, or 19 to 22% in constant currency.
Regarding the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, even with continuing COVID challenges, we posted consolidated revenues of 681 million with CooperVision revenues of 507 million, up 1%, and CooperSurgical revenues of 174 million, up 7%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.17 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding.
Our myopia management portfolio continued to strengthen, including MiSight growing 82% to 3 million and CooperSurgical posted a very strong quarter with Paragard growing 16% and fertility 10%.
After the close of the quarter, we entered into an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture with EssilorLuxottica that we hope to close soon.
Our fourth-quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year over year, or 3% in constant currency to $681 million.
Within CooperVision, as Al mentioned, we acquired the remaining 80% stake of SightGlass Vision in January for $41 million in cash plus aggregate potential earn-outs of up to $139 million based on revenue milestones and regulatory approvals.
This is all extremely exciting and supports our goal of reaching or exceeding 25 million of MiSight sales this fiscal year and over 50 million next year.
Lastly, on free cash flow, we now expect to approach 500 million this year as operating cash flow improves, and capex reduces.
And we repurchased -- I'm sorry, we purchased it for $52 million in cash plus a potential earn-out of up to $14 million.
Overall revenues were 174 million, up a healthy 7% as markets rebounded and we took share.
Revenues grew 10% year over year to 70 million with strikes seen around the world and throughout our product portfolio.
We've also made advancements in discussions with several large retailers and buying groups regarding MiSight and even moved into a test phase with one large retailer for roughly 70 stores.
It's estimated that roughly one-third of the world is currently myopic, and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050.
