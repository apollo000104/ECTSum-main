On a per share basis, first quarter earnings were $1.93 compared to a loss per share of $1.06 last year and earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter of 2019.
Excluding these items, first quarter non-GAAP earnings were $1.96 per share, a significant reversal to the loss per share of $0.67 for the first quarter of last year and up 28.1% compared to earnings per share of $1.53 for the first quarter of 2019.
This year's quarter includes pre-tax charges of $2 million related to the impairment of one of the company's minority investments, and $2 million primarily related to severance costs in connection with the reorganization of certain support functions.
For the full year, we now expect to open approximately 160 stores, remodel or relocate 120 and close 240.
And we will continue to enhance our storytelling in Q2 through our celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Griffey 1 with our Nike concept and our second installment of All Day I Dream About Sneakers with Adidas.
Our comp sales increased 80.3% in spite of store closures in Europe and Canada and supply chain pressures in the U.S. and EMEA.
On the latter, in addition to our work to advance education and economic opportunities for the black communities we serve, we have also established partnerships with 45 new black-owned brands and creators to provide a platform to showcase their design collaborations this year.
We also closed 58 stores in the quarter, primarily in the U.S., leaving us with 2,952 company-owned stores at the end of Q1.
Total sales increased 83% over last year and 3.6% over Q1 of 2019.
This, coupled with leverage on our SG&A expense, drove a meaningful swing in first quarter earnings per share versus last year's loss and a nearly 30% increase over Q1 of 2019.
We anticipate SG&A to be elevated compared to 2020 as we lap the unique elements that benefited Q2 last year, including $17 million in government subsidies and reduced store operating costs.
For the second quarter, looking at sales, keep in mind that our comps were up nearly 19% last year in what is historically our lowest volume quarter of the year.
Please keep in mind that we face a $6 million headwind for rent abatements we obtained in Q2 last year.
We continue to see enrollment increase with over 20 million members now enrolled in the countries where the program is active.
We continue to feel that impact on our business in Europe and Canada, where roughly 230 stores are temporarily closed.
This funded the opening of 12 new stores as well as the remodeling or relocating of 15 stores.
