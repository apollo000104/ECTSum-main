For Q4 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 to $0.52.
We now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96.
With strong execution across the business and despite two unanticipated one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3.
Additionally, given our record levels of free cash flow year to date and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, that is a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.
Revenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality.
Our Q3 orders were up strong double digits year over year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our edge-to-cloud offerings.
We are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21, and we'll update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October.
We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share, up 28% and 27% year over year, respectively.
We also booked two one-time charging totally $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud involving a channel partner in APJ.
Even with these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit.
Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter and in line with normal sequential seasonality, also in line with our outlook that factored in some of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged.
And you can see our efforts in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year to date that also reflects the strengthening demand environment and a substantial order book we have across the business.
Our annualized revenue run rate this quarter was $705 million, up 33% year over year, driven by strong as-a-Service orders growth, up 46% year over year.
In our high-performance compute and mission-critical solutions business, revenue was up 9% year over year, driven by a record number of new orders.
We paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October.
As a result, we now expect other income and expense for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately $50 million.
