We're very pleased with our performance this quarter as we achieved earnings of $624 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.65.
We anticipate being back in the repurchase market this quarter and expect to manage common equity Tier 1 to the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range by year-end.
Including PPP and the EnerBank acquisition, linked quarter net interest income is expected to grow between 5% and 6% in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income increased 4% sequentially.
Adjusted non-interest expenses increased 3% in the quarter, as higher salary and benefits and professional and legal fees were offset by decline in marketing expenses.
And we continue to expect they will remain 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic levels.
Net interest income from PPP loans decreased $12 million from the prior quarter, but is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter.
Share repurchases were temporarily paused ahead of the EnerBank closing, which absorbed approximately $1 billion of capital in the fourth quarter.
And based on analysis of pandemic-related deposit inflow characteristics, we currently believe approximately 30% or $10 billion to $12 billion of deposit increases can be used to support longer-term growth through the rate cycle.
Roughly 75% of that amount has either been recognized or is locked into future earnings from hedge terminations reflecting the dynamic management of our hedging strategy.
Salaries and benefits increased 4%, primarily due to higher variable-based compensation associated with elevated fee income as well as one additional day in the third quarter.
Cash averaged $25 billion during the quarter and when combined with PPP, reduced third quarter reported margin by 54 basis points.
Adjusted non-interest income increased 8% from the prior quarter, primarily attributable to strong capital markets' activity, including record loan syndication revenue and solid M&A advisory fees.
Excluding excess cash and PPP, net interest income grew almost 1.5% linked quarter, and our adjusted margin was essentially stable at 3.30%.
In addition, production remained strong with a line of credit commitments increasing $2 billion year-to-date.
Adjusted average and ending loans increased approximately 1% during the quarter.
