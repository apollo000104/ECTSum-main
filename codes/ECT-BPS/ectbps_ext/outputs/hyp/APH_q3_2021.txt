GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, an increase of 20% compared to $0.56 in the prior year period.
The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2,818,000,000 and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.67 and $0.65 respectively.
And adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $0.65, an increase of 18% compared to $0.55 in the third quarter of 2020.
Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full-year sales of $10,540,000,000 to $10,600,000,000, and full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.39 to $2.41.
Given this, and assuming constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2,690,000,000 to $2,750,000,000, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.61 to $0.63.
Sales were up 21% in U.S. dollars, 20% in local currencies and 13% organically compared to the third quarter of 2020.
This would represent year-over-year sales growth of 11% to 13% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 7% to 11%.
This outlook represents full year sales and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23% and 28% to 29%, respectively.
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter.
On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2020.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels, but for the full year 2021, we expect sales to increase more than 40% from prior year, a very strong performance.
Operating income was $571 million in the third quarter.
Sales were flat compared to prior year, and declined by about 19% organically as the benefit of our recent acquisitions was offset by continued declines in demand from aircraft manufacturers.
Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars, in local currencies and organically.
Our EPS, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% to a new record $0.65, and that's just an excellent reflection, once again, of our organization's continued strong execution.
On an organic basis, our sales increased by 13% with broad-based growth across most of our served markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program.
