Skechers third quarter revenue of $1.55 billion was a new record for the period and a remarkable achievement given the ongoing global supply chain disruptions just discussed.

Skechers direct-to-consumer business achieved the highest quarterly sales gains, increasing 44%, driven by a 61% increase in our international business and a 35% increase in our domestic business.
Quarterly gross margin remained strong at 49.6% primarily driven by higher average selling prices and fewer promotions in our direct-to-consumer business, partially offset by increases in freight costs.
