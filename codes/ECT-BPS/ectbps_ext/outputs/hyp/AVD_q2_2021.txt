With regard to our sales performance for the second quarter of 2021, the Company's net sales increased by 29% to $135 million as compared to net sales of $105 million this time last year.
We said gross profit margins, we are forecasting to be similar to recent years, and at the half, we're right at the same 39%.
Operating expenses, some increases driven by our growth initiatives, and as a percent of sales, up -- for net as a percent of sales, we're down 1%.
We are reporting $5.1 million in net income as compared to $3.9 million last year, a quarter-over-quarter increase of 32%.
Within that overall improvement, our US sales increased by 44% to $84 million and our International sales increased by 10% to $51 million.
Operating expenses for the quarter increased by $9.5 million or 28% as compared to the same period of the prior year.
So, with regards to revenue, we said that we would be in low double-digit increase, and at the half now, we're looking at a 25% increase in our revenue.
We are at that 2.5 times level, but in the second half, we expect to move that down and, short [Phonetic] of acquisition, we'd probably expect to maybe even be below that 2 number.
Our tax rate, we expect for the year to end up at the mid 20%s range, we're actually up 31% versus 23%, but we are still thinking we will wind up as we have some tax benefits that we'll see coming for us in fourth quarter.
For those of you that focus on EBITDA, we're now saying that our EBITDA for the year will wind up growing at a faster rate than revenue as well, and for the half, we've got a 29% increase.
If, for a moment, we exclude the impact of products and entities acquired since December of 2019, our base inventory has reduced by 11% from $177 million at that time to $158 million this year.
Our consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four quarters to June 30, 2021, was $59 million as compared to $52 million for the four quarters to June 30, 2020.
With regard to our Q2 2021 International sales, we saw increased sales of 10% and a strong increase in gross margin, which were up 35%.
So, it's a huge increase when [Phonetic] accounted that generally a freighter coming across has about $73 million of revenue that now has moved up to $420 million of revenue, so quite a big increase.
For the first half of 2021, we increased sales by 25%; gross margins by 24%; and operating expenses have reduced when compared to net sales; our interest expense is down; and net income has improved by 86%.
Our current inventory target at the end of the financial year is $150 million.
