Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2021 is $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share.
Major drivers for the change between our 2020 normalized FFO of $3.26 per share and the midpoint of $2.70 from our 2021 guidance include a $0.60 decline in same store NOI based on the revenue and expense assumptions outlined.
We incurred in approximately $30 million reduction in revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 due to uncollected rent.
In the pandemic period overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with the Bachelor's degree or better, which is our target demographic peaked at 8.4% and is now gone down to 3.8%.
Let's start with our full-year 2021 total same store revenue guidance range, which is between -9% and -7%.
As Mark mentioned, our collections have remained strong and consistent at approximately 97%.
Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today.
Both are estimated to have more meaningful growth in the 4% to 5% range.
Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon's announcement that it's putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston, and with the recent commencement of construction on Disney's new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs.
Occupancy is just below 94% and has improved 150 basis points since the beginning of November.
By continuing our efficiency initiatives and keeping our eye on the ball, we should still be able to limit payroll growth for the full year to around 2%.
We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January, we expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year.
Application count exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity that have move-in, outpace move-out despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level.
Our Los Angeles portfolio maintained occupancy above 95% through the quarter, concession use was modest and averaged just under one month on about 20% of our applications.
This is the second year in a row that payroll growth has been less than 1%.
That means as disclosed on Page 12 of the release, of the $31 million in cash residential concessions granted in 2020, we still have approximately $19 million of unamortized concessions that were reduced revenue in 2021, which is about 75 basis points of same store revenue.
