Revenue was up 47% and our diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.38 and $1.53, respectively.
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share also advanced to a new high in the quarter, improving to a $1.53, which was up $0.99 compared to adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and actually up $0.16 or 12% sequentially.
Now assuming no new major pandemic-related lockdowns or changes in worldwide economic conditions, financial markets, and foreign exchange rates, and including fee from the Lucas Group, we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to range from $640 million to $660 million and our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to range from $1.42 to $1.58 while our GAAP diluted earnings per share should range from $1.38 to $1.56.
Our adjusted EBITDA grew $69 million year-over-year and $13.5 million or 11% sequentially to $135 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, both are new quarterly highs.
So as Gary mentioned, fee revenue in the second quarter grew $204 million or 47% year-over-year and $54 million or 9% sequentially, reaching an all-time high of $639 million.
And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%.
Fee revenue growth in the quarter for our consolidated Executive Search business was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially while our RPO and Professional Search business was up 76% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.
Although our search businesses, both Pro Search and Executive Search combined represent about 45% of our revenue, we believe there is still substantial market opportunity ahead, given the acceleration of an increasingly nomadic labor market.
I would also say that this is not our 15 minutes of fame.
We're going to also scale our learning development outsourcing or LDO capabilities, leveraging our Korn Ferry Advance platform, in which we now have completed 50,000 development and coaching sessions.
Consulting grew 30% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, while Digital was up 18% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.
Global fee revenue for KF Digital was $88.6 million in the second quarter, which was up 18% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially.
Elements of our strategy will include driving a top-down go-to-market strategy, through our Marquee and Regional Accounts, which represent about 36% of our portfolio and that not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships, but is also key to more scalable and durable revenues.
In the second quarter, Consulting generated $164.9 million of fee revenue, which was up approximately $38 million or 30% year-over-year and $16 million or 11% sequentially.
Our firm's fee revenue for the fiscal year '22 Q2 year-to-date period is up 25% with double-digit growth in every line of business.
In addition to the Lucas Group and investing in the hiring of additional fee earners and execution staff, year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately $14 million of our stock and have paid cash dividends of approximately $14 million as well.
