Altogether, earnings per share were $1.59, up 6%.
For the third quarter, Stifel's net revenues were $883 million, up 8% from the prior year, representing the fourth highest quarterly revenue in our history.
Likewise, we achieved record nine month institutional revenue as record capital raising and brokerage more than compensated for a 13% decline in advisory revenue.
In fact, for the 12 months ending September 30, 2020, Stifel generated revenue of more than $3.6 billion, up 14% from the 12 months ending September 30, 2019.
Our firmwide net interest margin declined to 190 basis points, which was consistent with the bank's net interest margin declining to 237 basis points.
In the fourth quarter, assuming a stable share price and no repurchases, we estimate our average fully diluted share count will be 77.4 million shares.
This diversification is illustrated by record nine month wealth management revenue despite significant declines in net interest income and deposit sweep fees, both a result of the Fed's implementation of a 0 rate environment.
We estimate that non-comp operating expenses in the fourth quarter will represent between 19% and 21% of net revenue.
Given NIM expectations, we expect our NII in the fourth quarter to be between $100 million and $110 million, which is in line with our third quarter guidance.
On our most severe scenario, we would be approximately $60 million under accrued.
Non-comp operating expenses, excluding the credit loss provision and expenses related to investment banking transactions totaled approximately $173 million and represented less than 20% of our net revenue.
Pretax margins were 19.4%, annualized return on tangible common equity was 22.2% and tangible book value per share increased 13% over last year to $32.34.
We expect our firmwide net interest margin in the fourth quarter to come in between 190 and 200 basis points given the impact of the maturity of our five year debt in December.
Third quarter wealth management revenue totaled $527 million, up 4% sequentially.
For the quarter, net interest income totaled $101 million, which was down $14 million sequentially.
Through nine months, we generated record net revenue of $1.1 billion, which is up 33% from last year.
