Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $119 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.61.
We're raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.12 at the low end of the range and by $0.13 at the high end of the range to $7.77 to $8.08.
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.11 grew 21.3%.
On that basis, first quarter revenue is expected to be between $3,150 million and $3,200 million representing reported growth of 14.4% to 16.2%.
For the full year GAAP net income was $279 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21.3% in the fourth quarter to $2.11.
The revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3,298 million, which was $108 million above the high end of our guidance range.
Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $6.42.
And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $1.81 and $1.87 up 20.7% to 24.7%.
As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $5.9 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year.
We expect $5.9 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which represent a year-over-year increase of 13.5%.
Revenue for the full year was $11,359 million, which was up 2.4% reported and 2.3% at constant currency.
And you'll recall that we've committed to deleveraging between 3.5 times and 4 times net leverage as we exit 2022 and you can expect that we'll make good progress toward this target in 2021 due to our double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and improved free cash flow conversion.
We've increased our adjusted EBITDA by $35 million at the low end of the range and by $40 million at the high end of the range, resulting in full-year guidance of $2,760 million to $2,840 million.
We're raising our full year guidance by $250 million for revenue at the low end of the range and by $300 million at the high end of the range.
The new revenue guidance is $12,550 million to $12,900 million, a little under half of that increase is driven by a stronger outlook for the business and the remainder is from favorable FX new events versus the guidance we provided on our third quarter call.
