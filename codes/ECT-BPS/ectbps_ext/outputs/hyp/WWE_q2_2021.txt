In January, WWE issued adjusted OIBDA guidance of $270 million to $305 million for the full year 2021.
Total WWE revenue was $265.6 million, an increase of 19% reflecting the increased monetization of content across platforms, including growth from the staging of WrestleMania with ticketed fans in attendance.
Adjusted OIBDA declined 7% with $68.1 million, primarily due to higher television production expenses associated with the staging of WWE ThunderDome and to a lesser extent WrestleMania at Raymond James Stadium, both of which were produced in our performance center a year ago.
Similarly, the July 19 episode of Raw generated an 8% year-over-year increase in total viewers and a 15% increase in the 18 to 49 demo.
As Vince was mentioning earlier, the July 16 episode of SmackDown generated a 21% year-over-year increase in total viewers and a 42% increase in the coveted 18 to 49 demo.
First-time we played before large crowd on July 16, it was up 42% increase in 18 to 49 demo, which was extraordinary, Raw of 15% as well.
Since the return of our live audience, however, Raw ratings are up 22% in the 18 to 49 demo and SmackDown ratings are up 20%.
The report highlighted our various initiatives through the pandemic including generating 12.5 million in kind media value and over 650 million impressions for our community partners as WWE continues to deliver on our mission of putting smiles on people's faces.
