Same restaurant sales decreased 47.7%, and adjusted diluted net loss per share was $1.24.
We expect to achieve approximately 70% of prior year sales levels, total EBITDA of at least $75 million and diluted net earnings per share of greater than or equal to zero on a diluted share base of 131 million shares.
Now turning to the results, the total sales were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 43%.
This negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.30, which was not adjusted out of reported earnings.
Our adjusted debt to adjusted capital at the end of the quarter was 61%, well within our debt covenant of 75%.
The entire $300 million -- $390 million of impairment charges were adjusted out of our reported earnings.
We permanently closed 11 restaurants in the quarter, six of which were already impaired.
We ended the quarter with $763 million in cash and another $750 million available in our credit facility.
During the quarter, we impaired $390 million of assets as a result of lower sales, reduced profitability and lower market capitalization.
For the full year, we intend to open between 35 and 40 net new restaurants.
With last week's blended same restaurant sales down 30%, we are operating cash flow positive at these levels.
Not much has changed over those 23 years, except today, we order salads instead of two or three entrees each.
This gives us over $1.5 billion of liquidity available to weather the crisis and make appropriate investments to grow profitably.
During the quarter, we suspended the dividend and share repurchases, fully drew down our $750 million credit facility, took out a $270 million term loan and raised over $500 million in a follow-on equity offering.
Restaurant expenses per operating week decreased over 20%, given our focus on cost management, even as we incurred over $5 million in incremental cleaning supplies and PPE related to COVID-19.
It has been 14 weeks since our last earnings call.
