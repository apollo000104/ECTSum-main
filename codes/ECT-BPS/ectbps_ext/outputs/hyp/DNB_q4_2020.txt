Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.06.
Net income for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis was $7 million or a diluted income per share of $0.02 compared to a net loss of $263 million for the prior-year quarter.
We had a full-year net loss of $176 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.48 compared to a net loss of $599 million for the prior year.
Fourth-quarter adjusted net income was $118 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28, an increase from fourth quarter's 2019's adjusted net income of $51.5 million.
For adjusted EBITDA, excluding the deferred revenue adjustment of $17.4 million in Q1 2020, we are projecting adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter to be at the low end of our range as the annualization of cost savings for 2020 are partially offset with increased public company costs of approximately $4 million per quarter in the first half and $1.5 million per quarter in the second half.
Excluding the deferred revenue adjustment of $17.4 million in Q1 2020, we are projecting adjusted revenue growth in the first quarter of 2021 to be at the low end of our guidance range as we work through the end of the Data.com wind-down and the impact of COVID-19.
Fourth-quarter revenues were up 1.8%, excluding the net benefit of the lower deferred revenue purchase accounting impact.
Adjusted revenues are expected to be in the range of $2,145 million to $2,175 million, an increase of approximately 23.5% to 25% compared to full-year 2020 adjusted revenues of $1,738 million.
On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter revenues were $480 million, an increase of 11% or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter.
Subsequent to the application of these elimination, the incremental adjusted revenues will have a 19-point impact on the total full-year growth, which includes the sun-downing of approximately $50 million in legacy solutions revenues that we expect to have fully run off by the end of 2022.
Additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows: Interest expense of $200 million to $210 million; depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $90 million, excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%; weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 430 million; and finally, capex of approximately $160 million.
We are currently estimating $65 million of elimination that will be EBITDA-neutral but does impact comparability to the prior revenues and expenses reported by Bisnode through Ratos.
Adjusting for the previously communicated headwinds, normalized revenues on a constant-currency basis were up 3.5% for the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year.
This includes the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $39 million.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $855 million, an increase of approximately 17.5% to 19.5%, compared to full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $715 million.
We also have identified approximately $40 million in annualized run-rate savings that we expect to have actioned by the end of 2022.
