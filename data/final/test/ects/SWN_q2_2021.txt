Our quarterly reports and our definitive proxy statements for the special meeting regarding the Indigo transactions all are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although, we believe the expectations expressed are based on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results on developments may differ materially, and we are under no obligation to update them.
We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparisons across periods and with peers.
We appreciate you joining us today and I hope that you're all safe and well.
His strategic perspective and disciplined approach really complement our existing strategy and our management team.
I look forward to working with both of these talented leaders as we continue to execute our strategy to enhance sustainable value for our shareholders.
Southwestern Energy's returns driven strategy focuses on creating sustainable value protecting financial strength, consistently delivering leading operational and financial results and pursuing opportunities to capture the benefits of increasing scale.
At the core of our strategy and value proposition is a commitment to the right people doing the right things.
Our success depends on the alignment and commitment of a fully engaged diverse and inclusive workforce nurtured by our high performing innovative and value-driven culture.
In the second quarter, we took additional steps to deliver further value enhancements from our strategy and action.
The highlight of the quarter was the announced acquisition of Indigo Natural Resources.
The integration planning process is going well and ahead of schedule.
The shareholder vote is set for August 27 and we expect to close shortly thereafter.
This transaction expands the scope and scale of our Company by combining core positions across the country's two premier natural gas basins and accelerates the delivery of key financial and strategic objectives.
Because of Indigo's low-cost structure and strong balance sheet, we expect to see immediate accretion to key financial metrics, including improvement in corporate returns and increase in free cash flow and the accelerated delivery of our deleveraging goal later this year.
Indigo furthers our sustainable value creation strategy by expanding our overall opportunity set and moderating risks to our business.
The expansion in the Haynesville adds Tier-1 dry gas inventory locations that complement our existing Appalachia inventory.
These locations are adjacent to premium gas markets including LNG and other growing demand centers.
Notably, the firm sales agreements and fixed basis differentials will expand the Company's margins and dampen its overall basis volatility.
SWN is well positioned to capture the many tangible benefits of scale that this transaction brings including cost economies, expanded inventory and further capital allocation optionality.
The benefits improve the sustainability of our free cash flow generation, particularly as commodity prices continue to improve.
We are on track to deliver the promised synergies at closing and furthermore we see the potential for additional value enhancements once the transaction closes from operational and commercial improvements, a strengthened credit self [Phonetic] profile and a lower cost of capital.
We are proven integrators and I'm confident that our new combined Haynesville team will find ways to deliver additional value from our newly integrated business.
SWN's commitment to sustainability goes beyond the economics of a scale-enhancing transaction like Indigo, it is the ultimate objective of our ESG strategy as well.
Responsibly sourced gas is one of our key initiatives.
This quarter, we implemented a basinwide program to certify and continuously monitor all of our Appalachia Basin unconventional wells through an agreement with Project Canary.
We have a long history with the firm as we've been marketing responsibly sourced gas for several years to end users in the Eastern United States.
We specifically selected a certification provider that utilizes a rigorous and comprehensive process.
The basinwide well certification process and site monitoring has begun and we have already installed continuous monitors at several operating sites across our Pennsylvania acreage enabling our operating teams to immediately address potential emissions should they occur.
Southwestern is a leading natural gas producer that is well positioned for a low-carbon future.
We have a unique combination of a strong balance sheet, large scale Tier-1 operated assets, proven execution and ESG performance providing the means to deliver sustainable value creation.
We continue to believe disciplined consolidation and the benefits of scale are core to our strategy for driving shareholder value.
We remain committed to holding capital investment at maintenance capital levels and disciplined in our risk management strategy including hedging.
Over the next few quarters, we will further refine our capital allocation strategy including additional debt reduction and the potential return of capital to shareholders.
Operationally, 2Q was another active quarter and our teams continue to deliver results within our guidance ranges while ensuring the continued protection of our people and our operations from the ongoing challenges presented by COVID-19.
Our 2021 plan is on track and we look forward to operating in the Haynesville.
I'll start with some highlights from the quarter.
Total production was 276 Bcfe or 3 Bcfe per day.
This included 2.4 Bcf per day of gas representing 79% of total production and approximately 104,000 barrels per day of oil and NGLs flat to the first quarter and consistent with our maintenance capital program.
During the quarter, we averaged five drilling rigs, two in Pennsylvania, two in West Virginia and one in Ohio with two frac crews.
As planned, we invested $259 million of capital in the quarter and expect Q3 to trend lower with a further decrease in Q4.
The shaping of our maintenance capital investment in 2021 is consistent with our well-established approach of front-end loading and tapering in the second half of the year.
We brought 31 wells to sales in the quarter, drilled 23 and completed 19.
Costs on wells to sales were in line with the first quarter at $626 per foot with an average lateral length of approximately 14,000 feet.
While we are starting to see some inflationary impacts mainly related to diesel, steel and labor, due to our vertical integration proactive procurement strategy and operational efficiency gains, we continue to expect low-single-digit deflation in 2021.
In Southwest Appalachia, we brought online our first Ohio Utica dry gas pad and achieved our $100 per foot cost reduction goal with an average well cost of $728 per foot.
This three well pad had an average lateral length of approximately 13,700 feet and an average 30-day rate of 25 million cubic feet per day, all performing in line with expectations.
In Northeast Appalachia, we continue to drive operational efficiencies to reduce costs and enhance the capital program returns.
We placed 11 wells to sales in the quarter with an average well cost of $531 per foot at an average lateral length of approximately 11,600 feet.
These wells had an average 30-day rate of 14 million cubic feet per day.
As Bill mentioned, we are excited to join with our newest colleagues from Indigo and hit the ground running in the Haynesville.
We are currently doing our operational technical and HSE planning and we'll have a great operating team in place that represents a combination of employees from both Indigo and SWN.
Initially, we will be focused on incorporating current Haynesville best practices and then look to combine that knowledge with our own operational expertise.
I'm excited to join the team and help build on the momentum SWN has generated through its base business and acquisition progress.
As Bill mentioned earlier, this quarter, the Company accelerated delivery on its financial goals.
It generated free cash flow for the third consecutive quarter.
We're on track with the 2021 plan to generate meaningful annual free cash flow, expecting free cash flow generation to accelerate in the second half of this year.
Once the transaction closes, we will provide updated guidance to account for the addition of Indigo.
The solid quarterly financial results further improved our leverage ratio by almost half turn to 2.6 times.
Liquidity remains in good shape with just under $570 million in borrowings and $1.2 billion of capacity on a credit facility.
With the accretive acquisition of Indigo and current robust commodity price outlook, we expect to achieve our two-time sustainable leverage goal by late 2021.
The key part of achieving this financial strength has been SWNs commodity and basis hedging strategy, which is directly linked with Company's enterprise risk management strategy.
The Company incorporates balance sheet strength leverage, commodity and basis fundamentals and the benefits to the Company's financial strength resulting from acquisitions among other aspects in determining the level and instruments hedging that will be employed.
As a result of our basis hedging strategy, the Company maintained its full year guidance despite widening basis in Appalachia.
As we integrate Indigo and update our capital allocation strategy in the coming months, we continue to ensure that our commodity and risk management strategy and practice remains aligned with the Company's risk profile in our long-term value creation objectives.
