These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.
We use adjusted constant dollar amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.
You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with US GAAP.
Due to the significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our prior year figures, today's call also contains certain comparisons to the same period in fiscal 2020 for additional context.
These comparisons are all under the reported dollar basis.
On June 28, 2021, the company completed the sale of its Occupational Workwear business.
Accordingly the company has reported the related held for sale assets and liabilities of this business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and included the operating results and cash flows of this business in disc ops for all periods through the date of sale.
Joining me on the call will be VF's Chairman, President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and EVP and CFO, Matt Puckett.
We are encouraged by the strong start to our fiscal 2022 year.
Our teams delivered an outstanding first quarter powering VF back to pre-pandemic revenue levels while driving an earnings recovery well ahead of our initial expectations.
We continue to see broad based momentum across the portfolio, which furthers my confidence in our ability to accelerate growth through fiscal 2022 and beyond.
While the near-term environment remains somewhat clouded by virus surges in Southeast Asia, uncertainties in other regions brought on by the impact of new variants and further pressures on the global supply chain, our teams are executing.
We remain focused on the things that we can control and winning the parts of our business with the consumers coming back strong.
And we remain confident in our ability to continue driving this sharp recovery across our business.
Matt, will walk you through our results in detail, but I'll start off with some Q1 highlights.
VF revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels growing 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion with momentum across brands, regions, and channels.
Our global DTC business delivered high single-digit growth relative to prior peak levels driven by a strong acceleration from our brick and mortar stores in the US and continued strength in our digital.
Our organic DTC digital business is now 72% above fiscal 2020 levels including the growing benefit of our omnichannel capabilities as we serve our consumers seamlessly across their choice of channel.
We've seen a sharp recovery in our wholesale business, which grew over 100% organically in Q1 approaching prior peak fiscal 2020 levels.
Strong sell-through trends and clean channel inventory levels from the past year are now translating into stronger fall '21 and spring '22 order books supporting an improving outlook for our wholesale business for this year and beyond.
We've seen a strong recovery in our gross margin, which grew 260 basis points to 56.7% in Q1.
This represents organic gross margin expansion relative to prior peak fiscal 2020 levels despite a 30 basis point headwind from a more challenging logistics and freight environment.
VF drove organic earnings growth of 133% delivering $0.27 in Q1.
essentially doubling our plan.
We're pleased to see our top line momentum and strong gross margin expansion translate into better than anticipated, SG&A leverage and earnings flow through an indication of the upside potential of our model as our recovery accelerates.
Now, turning to our brand highlights from the quarter.
The Vans brand as returned to pre-pandemic revenue levels growing 102% in Q1.
The recovery has been led by global DTC business, which drove double-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020 led by 73% growth in digital.
This DTC strength has been broad based with each region reporting positive DTC growth relative to pre-pandemic levels.
More Vans consumers have returned to in-person shopping experiences earlier than expected and we see encouraging trends in our DTC KPIs with consumers buying more frequently and spending more per purchase relative to historic levels.
In EMEA despite the continued impact of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, the Vans business grew 125% this quarter representing 30% growth relative to fiscal 2020, with strength across all major markets as stores reopened throughout the region.
Vans APAC business grew 19% in Q1, led by 22% growth in China.
June marked a milestone for the brand in China with the stock launch of the Vans Family program while the official launch will be celebrated with the Super Brand Day on Tmall tomorrow.
We have already registered over one million new loyalty members following the initial launch bringing Global Vans Family membership to nearly 17 million consumers.
Vans kicked off it's 52 week drop calendar this quarter seeking to create a consistent, predictable, globally aligned and focused approach to drive brand energy and consumer engagement.
Seven weeks into the program, we are encouraged by the initial consumer reads and the instance sell out of several early drops.
Internally, the Vans team has increased its focus, energy, and resources around driving newness and compelling storytelling, which we believe will unlock further long-term value for the brand.
The team is on track to more formally market the Vans drop list in fiscal Q3 ahead of the fall holiday season.
We remain bullish on the set up for Vans moving through fiscal 2022 and are encouraged by the early reads from the back to school season underway.
We are raising off our full year outlook to growth of 28% to 29%, representing growth of 9% to 10% relative to fiscal 2020.
Moving on to the North Face.
Global brand revenues increased 83% representing 6% growth above pre-pandemic levels.
All regions rebounded sharply in Q1, highlighted by continued exceptional performance in EMEA, which grew 142% versus the prior year, and 58% relative to fiscal '20, despite the impact of door closures over the period.
The APAC business grew 22% in Q1, highlighted by 80% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
The North Face's spring sell-through rates where some of the highest in years reflecting strong progress on the brand's ability to drive 365 day relevancy.
TNF continues to drive energy in on-mountain categories with the FutureLight franchise as well as the Vectiv footwear rollout, further establishing its legitimacy in outdoor footwear.
We also see outsized growth in the casual categories such as logo wear, which grew over 100% in Q1 as consumers show strong engagement with the brand Off-Mountain.
TNF loyalty program the XPLR Pass has grown to over 7 million consumers adding nearly 300,000 new members in Q1, driven by exclusive member experiences and reaching the consumer journey.
We continue to be encouraged by the broad-based global momentum at The North Face and now expect the brand delivered 26% to 27% growth this year, representing 15% to 17% growth relative to fiscal 2020.
Alongside the significant top line recovery, we're seeing strong improvements in profitability and continue to expect mid teen profitability for TNF in fiscal 2022.
The Timberland brand delivered 63% growth in Q1 tracking ahead of plan.
We are encouraged by high-teens growth in the Americas, and 87% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 level.
We continue to see outsized growth from Outdoor, Apparel, and Timberland PRO each growing over 75% in the quarter.
Momentum behind core iconic product also continues with heritage styles being strong demand despite historically low inventories.
Our Timberland team remains committed to its purpose led vision highlighted by the recently announced Global Product Take-Back Program in partnership with ReCircled.
Beginning this fall US consumers will be able to return any Timberland product to a brand store to either be refurbished for resale or recycled into future products.
This program supports the brand's bold vision announced last fall for products to have a net positive impact on nature by 2030.
We are encouraged by Timberland's strong start to the year and as a result, we now expect the brand to deliver modest growth relative to fiscal 2020 surpassing pre-pandemic revenues beginning in Q2.
Dickies delivered another exceptional quarter, growing 58% in Q1, well ahead of our plan as the brand has kicked off several new campaigns and inventories become more available, we've been pleasantly surprised by the intensity of sell-through performance across all wholesale partners in the US.
This acceleration continues to be driven by both Work-Inspired Lifestyle product, which reported strong growth across all three regions as well as core work items.
Work-Inspired Lifestyle now represents about 40% global brand revenue.
Importantly, the Dickies brand has begun to deliver meaningful profitability improvements, driven by both gross margin expansion and SG&A efficiencies.
Q1 represented a strong start to our goal of returning to double-digit profit margins in the Work segment in fiscal 2022.
Following a strong Q1 performance and accelerating demand signals across channels, we are confident raising the full-year outlook for the Dickies brand to mid teen growth in fiscal 2022 representing over 25% growth relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
A quick update on Supreme we continue to be happy with the integration process.
The VF's supply chain organization continues to advance engagement with the Supreme teams with particular leverage opportunities in logistics capabilities, scale and relationships, which couldn't come in a more opportune time.
One quarter into our fiscal year, we remain confident in our outlook of $600 million and $0.25 from the brand.
Our strong results are reflection of the consistent execution, hard work and inspiring dedication of our teams around the world.
This continued passion and energy alongside the broad based nature of VF's acceleration give me great confidence in our ability to continue driving the strong recovery underway.
While the first quarter represents a small portion of our total year, we're starting off fiscal 2022 building up the great momentum which began in February of this year.
I'm really happy to update you on our strong Q1 results and revised outlook for the year.
We are encouraged by the continued broad-based momentum across our business and the set up for each of our big brands heading into the heart of our fiscal year.
Despite additional pressures throughout the global supply chain.
I remain confident in our team's ability to execute and to build on the strong earnings recovery delivered in Q1.
Let me start with an overview of the operating environment across geographic regions.
In the Americas, less than 5% of our stores were closed at the beginning of the quarter and all stores are currently operational.
The strong US consumer, easing US restrictions, and increased vaccination rates have encouraged a gradual recovery in foot traffic alongside continued strength in conversion.
Our Americas DTC business grew 84% organically in Q1, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, led by a sharper than expected recovery in our brick and mortar business.
Consumer appetite for athletic athleisure and outdoor categories remained strong benefiting our direct business as well as the performance of our key accounts.
Low inventories and strong sell-through trends continue to drive down promotional activity and improved quality of sales across the marketplace, which is resulting in stronger than expected order books for the upcoming fall and spring seasons.
Moving onto the EMEA region, while lockdown measures continue to affect economic activity our business has remained resilient.
Growing 97% organically in Q1, representing 13% growth relative to fiscal 2020.
Both wholesale and DTC channels returned to growth relative to 2020.
As continued strength from both our direct digital channel and from digital tightened partners have more than offset the impact of brick and mortar store closures.
About 60% of our EMEA stores were closed at the start of the first quarter.
As we sit here today, all of those doors have now reopened.
Consumer confidence is improving as restrictions ease and we've seen strong performance from our brick and mortar fleet following reopening.
For example, our UK business delivered triple-digit growth from open doors following 3 months of lockdown, representing growth of nearly 30%, relative to fiscal 2020.
Finally, our APAC region continues to deliver double-digit growth despite sporadic resurgence of the virus across many market.
Our China business grew 12% in Q1, which was impacted by a wholesale timing shift of revenues from Q1 into Q2.
Excluding this impact, China would have delivered mid teen growth this quarter.
We continue to see digitally led growth in the region, particularly with our tightened partners and remain confident in our ability to deliver greater than 20% growth in China in fiscal 2022.
While we remain pleased with our APAC performance to-date we are observing most Southeast Asian market facing various degrees of lockdowns and travel restrictions and while only about 5% of our stores are currently closed commercial activity has been impacted across most APAC markets outside of China and Hong Kong.
This latest wave also presents additional near-term uncertainty for our global supply chain.
In recent weeks more widespread virus outbreaks in key sourcing countries with lower levels of vaccinations have resulted in temporary factory lockdowns and manufacturing capacity constraints.
Our supply chain also continues to be impacted by port delays, equipment availability and other logistics challenges.
Essentially, every link in the supply chain has been impacted to varying degrees over the last 18 months.
And while we're not immune to this, we believe we've managed these challenges relatively better than most.
Our teams remain focused on delivering the products to satisfy increasing demand signals in the most cost effective and efficient way.
Some of the actions include using air freights, other means of expedited shipping and dual sourcing where appropriate.
While we remain confident in our ability to service our strong growth plan, there is a financial implications to these actions.
For example, we expect to spend more than $35 million in incremental expedited freight charges relative to fiscal 2020.
We view our supply chain is a key competitive advantage of VF and our teams are proving this now more than ever.
I want to echo Steve's appreciation for the supply chain teams' incredible execution over the past 18 months.
As a result of their tireless and tremendous effort, I remain confident in our ability to continue navigating this dynamic environment.
Now, moving into our Q1 financial results.
Total VF revenue increased 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion reaching pre-pandemic levels one quarter ahead of our initial expectations.
Our Q1 digital business is 72% above fiscal 2020 levels organically, representing a 31% two year CAGR.
We also continuously strengthened from key digital partners globally with pure play digital wholesale growth of over 70% relative to fiscal 2020.
VF total digital penetration was roughly a quarter of our Q1 revenues which represents about 2 times our penetration from the first quarter of 2020.
Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 56.7% representing organic expansion from Q1 peak gross margin levels in fiscal 2020.
Relative to last year, the strong expansion was driven by greater full price selling partially offset by the expedited freight costs and business mix as our wholesale business rebounded sharply in the quarter.
When compared to fiscal 2020 gross margins, we generated a strong mix benefit, partially offset by the incremental air freight costs and FX.
Operating margin expanded meaningfully to 6.8% driven by the strong gross margin performance and SG&A leverage relative to the prior year.
We delivered earnings per share of $0.27 in Q1, representing 133% organic growth driven by a stronger top line and earnings flow through relative to our initial expectations.
Owing to strong broad-based performance in Q1, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2022 outlook.
Our outlook today assumes no significant changes to the environment, including increased disruption to our supply chain operations.
VF's revenue is now expected to be at least $12 billion representing at least 30% growth from fiscal 2021 and mid-teen increase relative to our prior peak revenue in fiscal 2020.
Excluding the Supreme business, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies organic growth of at least 25% representing at least 9% organic growth relative to fiscal 2020.
As Steve covered, the increase to our revenue guidance is broad based across the portfolio, the stronger outlooks for each of our top core brands and sizable increases in two of our emerging brands, Altra and SmartWool.
Specifically, the improved outlooks are supported by stronger-than-anticipated order books and the accelerating DTC trends we've observed over the past five months.
Moving down to P&L we still expect gross margin to exceed 56% despite a 20 basis point to 30 basis point headwind from additional airfreight that wasn't assumed in our initial outlook.
We now expect operating margins to be at least 13%, an improvement of over 20 basis points from our initial outlook, a signal to the upside potential of our model as their topline accelerates.
Fiscal 2022 earnings per share is now expected to be at least $3.20 including a $0.25 per share contribution from the Supreme brand representing at least 20% earnings growth relative to fiscal 2020.
We continue to expect to generate over 1 billion operating cash flow this year with planned capital expenditures of about $350 million including the impact of growth investments, as well as deferred capital spending from fiscal 2021.
As announced on June 28, we closed the sale of the Occupational Work business this quarter providing roughly $615 million of additional liquidity.
These proceeds are reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook for total liquidity to exceed $4 billion.
We expect to exit this year with net leverage between 2.5 times and 3 times providing us meaningful near term optionality deploy excess capital moving forward.
We took bold decisive actions last year to position our brands and the enterprise with a strong recovery currently underway.
And the balanced broad based nature of this recovery, along with the continued optionality that our model provides gives me confidence in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth moving forward.
