Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Gary will discuss asset quality and Vince will review the financials.
Today, I'll touch on our 2020 financial highlights, review last year's accomplishments, and wrap up with a discussion about our strategic objectives.
First, I'd like to highlight some key metrics from our 2020 financial results.
Despite substantial challenges resulting from the pandemic, management took significant actions to protect our employees and preserve shareholder value, implementing measures to improve efficiency and increase profitability as we navigated the pandemic.
Looking at the fourth quarter, FNB reported operating earnings per share of $0.28, and operating return on tangible common equity increased to 15% building on the upper quartile returns relative to peers through the first nine months of 2020.
Turning to the income statement for fiscal year 2020, FNB reported record total revenue of $1.2 billion, operating net income of $314 million and operating earnings per share of $0.96, while building significant credit reserves to address economic risks associated with the pandemic.
These profitability levels resulted in strong internal capital generation driving our tangible common equity and the CET1 ratio to the highest levels in decades, and increasing tangible book value per share by 5% to $7.88.
Because of our performance in the prudent risk management culture, FNB continue to pay an attractive dividend.
Our portfolios continue to expand with full year average loan and deposit growth of 11% and 14%, respectively.
This growth was due to the resiliency of our bankers and the success of the Paycheck Protection Program with balanced contributions across our legacy footprint and added growth in our Southeastern markets.
Our leadership team prioritized a number of financial objectives during fiscal year 2020 designed to drive long-term results.
Reflecting on the 2020 operational initiatives we laid out in last year's letter to our shareholders, we made significant progress toward this objective in spite of a difficult operating environment.
We set out to deliver peer-leading returns on tangible common equity and drive internal capital generation and growth in tangible book value per share.
Our 2020 return on average tangible common equity of 13% and 5% growth in tangible book value continue to track above others in the industry.
Sustaining this trajectory through execution of this strategy should increase our relative valuation over time compared to peers.
In tandem with delivering this financial performance in a challenging environment, we set out to protect our attractive dividend, while optimizing capital deployment.
For the full year, we paid out $165 million in cash dividends and repurchased nearly $40 million of stock under our current stock repurchase program, returning over $200 million directly to shareholders.
From a capital planning perspective, we've now surpassed our previously stated target and completed the adoption of CECL, both leading to enhanced flexibility to optimize capital deployment in this environment.
During the second half of the year, we took significant steps to enhance future risk-adjusted returns through prudent balance sheet actions, notably the auto loan sale in November, reducing exposure to COVID-19-sensitive industries and the prepayment of higher cost liabilities.
These actions reduced overall credit risk, reduced future interest expense and provides us with more liquidity moving forward.
In the fourth quarter, we resumed the inaugural FNB share repurchase program after activity was halted in the first quarter due to uncertainty related to the pandemic.
When considering the total capital consumed by the dividend and share buyback combined, we are pleased to report an increase in year-end capital levels.
Approximately 25% of the total shares repurchased were below tangible book value, resulting in accretion to that metric.
The overarching goal of our organization is to grow revenue by prudently increasing our loan and deposit portfolios, all while maintaining superior credit quality and FNBs risk management culture through this cycle.
During a difficult operating environment, many of our teams exceeded loan and deposit origination targets, while improving our funding mix through a focus on bringing in low-cost deposits.
As a proof point, loans continue to grow even when excluding the impact of PPP and the auto loan portfolio sale.
On the deposit side, in addition to an improved deposit mix, non-interest bearing deposits surpassed $9 billion to end the year.
As a percentage of non-interest bearing deposits, our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits increased to 31%, up meaningfully from 24% five years ago.
FNB is in a very strong liquidity position with a loan deposit ratio of 87% to fund future loan growth with strengthened capital and enhanced liquidity.
Diversification and growth in our fee-based businesses, namely capital markets, mortgage banking and wealth management, contributed significantly to our record total non-interest income levels.
Our fee-based businesses had an outstanding year with many groups setting all-time records for revenue.
In 2020, capital markets, mortgage banking and wealth management achieved revenues of $39 million, $50 million and $49 million, respectively.
The strong performance was driven by increased contributions due to our geographic expansion strategy and providing value-added solutions to borrowers.
We continue to look for ways to diversify our fee income streams by executing on strategic initiatives such as growing the mezzanine finance group and enhancing FNB's debt capital markets capabilities.
Total operating non-interest income exceeded $300 million in 2020.
Through our continuous investment in both our digital and physical delivery channels, we aspire to provide our customers with intuitive and efficient solutions to meet their banking needs.
On the digital front, adoption rates from mobile banking users have increased exponentially in 2020, attributable to 18% growth in new users added to the platform in the last nine months.
Looking back over the last five years, we have now consolidated 111 branches, opened 12 de novo branches in attractive markets and expanded our ATM capabilities to exceed 800 locations.
These actions enabled FNB to optimize our overall footprint with limited disruption for our customers.
We have diligently invested in technology and risk management infrastructure by upgrading platforms in the retail bank and improving the customer experience.
We continue to evaluate our distribution network regarding consolidation efforts as we announced '21 consolidation to take effect in 2021.
Building on FNB strategy to grow its market presence, particularly in metropolitan Baltimore and Washington DC, we entered an agreement with Royal Farms, a regional convenience store operator, that enables us to connect cash distribution services with a robust, online and mobile banking offering, providing convenient access to essential banking products and services throughout a broader geographic region with the deployment of more than 220 ATM locations in the Mid-Atlantic region.
In addition to withdrawals, transfers and balance enquiries, several of the Royal Farms ATM will also feature check and cash depositing capabilities to provide customers with even greater flexibility and increased access to broader product offerings.
As evidence of successful execution of our growth strategy, according to the most recent FDIC data, we experienced deposit growth in 50 to 53 MSAs across our footprint.
FNB achieved top-5 share position in nearly half of those MSAs, further illustrating our ability to compete effectively in our market against a broad spectrum of competitors.
Additionally, we strive to continue to manage cost and improve efficiency.
This is evident by FNB achieving our stated 2020 cost savings floor of $20 million.
In addition to achieving the 2020 target, FNB also achieved its roughly $20 million cost target in 2019.
When including a plan to reduce an additional $21 million in expenses during full year 2021, in total, this amounts to more than $60 million of expense reduction over the three-year period.
Because of our proactive expense management initiative, our efficiency ratio remained at a good level at 56% despite pressures on net interest income in a challenging rate environment and continued capital investment in technology.
Our strategy is proven through varying cycles as evidenced by the solid performance and continued focus on improvement in many key asset quality metrics.
To expand on this topic, I'll ask Gary to comment on credit quality.
Our credit portfolio continued to perform in a satisfactory manner in the fourth quarter and we are very pleased with the position of our portfolio as we move into 2021.
Our key credit metrics showed improvement across a number of categories after we took steps during the quarter to proactively reduce exposure to borrowers most impacted in this COVID-sensitive environment, which drove a reduction in the level of delinquency and NPL.
Specifically we were successful in further reducing our limited exposure to the hotel and lodging industry by nearly 20%, which improved our position in this hardest-hit asset class that now stands at only 1.3% of the loan portfolio, exclusive of PPP loan balances.
Let's now review some of the highlights covering both the fourth quarter and full year results, followed by some commentary around COVID-sensitive portfolios and deferrals.
Turning first to credit quality, the level of delinquency came in at a very good level of 1.02% representing a 5 basis point improvement over the prior quarter.
And when excluding PPP loan volume, delinquency would have ended December at 1.11%.
The level of NPLs and OREO totaled 70 basis points, an improvement of 6 bps linked-quarter, while the non-GAAP level excluding PPP loans stood at 77 basis points.
We saw very positive OREO sales activity this quarter, which contributed to the $10 million linked-quarter reduction for an ending OREO balance of $8 million, a historically low level.
Additionally, we were successful in moving several credits off the books during Q4 to proactively de-risk the balance sheet, thereby further reducing NPL levels.
Net charge-offs for the quarter were $26.4 million or 41 basis points annualized, which reflects the actions taken to strategically move these select COVID-sensitive credits off the books, utilizing previously established reserves.
Our GAAP net charge-offs for the full year came in at a very solid 24 basis points.
Provision expense totaled $17 million for the quarter, ending December with the reserve position at 1.43%.
Excluding PPP loan volume, the non-GAAP ACL stands at 1.56% or a 5 basis point linked-quarter decrease, again due to the reductions in exposure across these COVID impacted sectors.
When including the remaining acquired unamortized discount, our total coverage stands at 1.8%.
The NPL reserve coverage position also remains favorable at 213%, reflecting a slight improvement linked-quarter.
I'd now like to provide you with an update on our loan deferral levels and COVID-sensitive industry exposure.
As it relates to our borrowers requesting payment deferral, 1.7% of the loan portfolio, excluding PPP was under a COVID-related deferral plan at December 31.
As I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress during the quarter to further reduce the limited exposure we have to higher risk segments, including travel and leisure, food services and energy.
On a linked-quarter basis, exposure to higher risk segments declined by nearly $90 million to stand at only 3.1% of the total loan portfolio.
The primary driver of the decrease was led by a $65 million reduction in hotel exposure, which as noted earlier in my remarks, stands at only 1.3% of our total loan portfolio.
Loan deferrals in the three higher risk segments ended the year at only 7%, down from the prior deferral level of 29% at the end of the third quarter.
In closing, we are very pleased with the progress made during the final quarter of the year in this COVID-sensitive environment with our credit metrics ending at very satisfactory levels as we enter 2021 very well-positioned.
We continue to closely monitor our book, and remain focused on managing risk in our COVID-impacted sectors as we work to further reduce portfolio exposure to these higher-risk industries that continue to face uncertainty in the current environment.
As we move into a new year, we look forward to an improving economy and an expanded lending opportunities ahead.
Today, I will discuss our financial results and discuss some of our current expectations.
As noted on Slide 5, fourth quarter operating earnings per share totaled $0.28, an increase of 8% compared to the third quarter.
Full year 2020 operating earnings per share totaled $0.96, after adjusting for $46 million of significant items.
While this year brought unique economic challenges, we were well-positioned to adapt to the environment and provide strong internal capital generation.
Vince mentioned, we increased our tangible book value per share to $7.88, an increase of 5% from 2019.
Despite a volatile year for equity markets, our combined dividend yield and share repurchases [Technical Issues] above pure median levels.
Looking at 2021, we are confident that returning to generating core positive operating leverage on a quarterly basis will lead to better overall performance compared to 2020.
Let's review the fourth quarter starting with the balance sheet on Page 10.
Average balances for total loans decreased 1.6% from the third quarter, largely due to the previously mentioned indirect auto sale of $500 million that was completed in November 2020.
Linked-quarter, PPP balances decreased $377 million on a spot basis as we received forgiveness remittances from the SBA throughout December.
Commercial loan line utilization rate is at 32%, which is about 8% or $0.5 billion in funded balances below what we would characterize as a normal level, creating upside for loan growth as the economy improves.
Average deposits grew 2%, with 4% growth in interest-bearing deposits and 3% growth in non-interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an 8% decrease in time deposits.
This continued total deposit growth provided ample liquidity and afforded us the opportunity to pay down an additional $300 million in FHLB borrowings with a rate of 2.35% during the fourth quarter.
Excluding the FHLB debt extinguishment from the third quarter, a total of $715 million in borrowings were terminated during the year with expense savings that will continue through 2022.
As Vince noted, FNB is in a very strong position to fund future loan growth, strengthen capital and enhance liquidity.
Turning to the income statement.
Net interest income increased $7.3 million or 3.2% compared to the third quarter and the net interest margin increased 8 basis points to 2.87%.
PPP loans added 17 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter as the level of net interest income from PPP increased $8.8 million compared to the third quarter, offsetting 3 basis points of negative impact from higher average cash balances, and 3 basis points of lower purchase accounting benefit on acquired loans.
Interest-bearing deposit costs improved 12 basis points to 43 basis points, and on a spot basis, were down another 7 basis points to 36 basis points.
Let's now look at non-interest income and expense on Slides 13 and 14.
Operating non-interest income totaled $81 million when excluding the $12.3 million loss and FHLB debt extinguishment.
Mortgage banking income remains strong at $15 million with large contributions from the Mid-Atlantic and Pittsburgh regions, and the results benefited from above average gain on sale margins compared to historical levels.
For the full year of 2020, mortgage banking increased 57%, reaching a record $50 million.
Wealth Management increased 5% from the third quarter due to the expanded footprint and positive market impacts on assets under management.
Capital markets, wealth management, mortgage banking and insurance are businesses we have strategically invested in over the last five years, providing diversified revenue streams that have served us well in this low interest rate environment.
In the aggregate, revenue from these businesses increased $32 million or 24% to $162 million for the full year of 2020.
Looking on Slide 14, non-interest expense totaled $199.3 million, an increase of $19.1 million or 10.6%, which included $10.5 million of branch consolidation expenses and $4.7 million of COVID-19-related expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $2.7 million of COVID-19 expenses in the third quarter.
Excluding these COVID-19 and branch consolidation expenses, non-interest expense increased $6.6 million or 3.7%, primarily driven by higher production-related commissions and incentives, as well as $2 million in outside services.
Ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets increased 5 basis points to 7.24% compared to September 30, 2020, with net PPP loan balances negatively impacting the December 31 and September 30, 2020 TCE ratios by 45 and 56 basis points, respectively.
Compared to the year ago quarter, the ratio decreased 35 -- 34 basis points due primarily to the PPP loan impact and the 2020 Day 1 CECL adoption impact.
On a linked-quarter basis, our CET1 ratio improved to an estimated 9.9% reflecting FNBs strategy to optimize capital deployment, increased over 40 basis points from year-end 2019.
Turning to our outlook, we'll offer quarterly guidance for the first quarter of 2021 and some high-level expectations for the full year of 2021.
I'll note that our assumptions do not take into account the impact of recently announced stimulus programs.
For the first quarter, we expect period end loans to decline low single-digits relative to December 31 assuming approximately $700 million of additional forgiveness for PPP loans in the first quarter.
Excluding PPP and purchase accounting, we expect first quarter net interest income to be at a similar level compared to the fourth quarter.
We expect continued solid contributions from fee-based businesses with continued strength in capital markets and mortgage banking, resulting in total non-interest income in the mid-to-high $70 million range.
We expect expenses to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter operating level.
For the full year of 2021, on a full year basis, we expect total revenues to decline low single-digits as top-line organic growth is offset by reduced contributions from purchase accounting compared to 2020.
We would expect loans to grow in the mid single-digits from the end of 2020, excluding impact of PPP forgiveness and net of any new PPP originations.
I'll note, this does not account for any additional government stimulus and assumes some level of line of credit utilization increase throughout the year as the U.S. economic conditions are expected to improve from where we stand today.
We would expect transaction deposits excluding PPP and stimulus to increase mid single-digits from year-end 2020.
We expect full year provision for credit losses to be in the $70 million to $80 million range based on our current macroeconomic assumptions.
We expect full year expenses to be down slightly from the $720 million operating level in 2020 as we execute on our expense savings target of $20 million, while continuing to invest in technology and infrastructure in 2021.
Lastly, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 19%, assuming no change to the statutory corporate tax rate of 21%.
Throughout the last year, we continued to focus our efforts on optimizing our online and physical delivery team to improve the customer experience, improve operational efficiency, as well as investing in our infrastructure and technology.
Our commitment to reinvesting a portion of our cost savings initiatives in our digital delivery channels was instrumental in our success, serving our clients and growing loans, deposits and fee-based business.
FNB will be adding a number of features to our mobile app in the first quarter, providing an improved offering to clients.
Once again, we received national recognition by S&P Global for having a top mobile application in terms of features and functionality for banks in the Northeast regional banking space.
As consumer preferences continue to evolve, our investment in our digital platform will enable us to reach new households in our expanded footprint.
Moving forward, we are focused on increasing the number of interaction through our online and mobile channels.
We are confident our digital offering, robust omnichannel presence, and innovative customer interface will provide multiple ways for our clients to utilize our complete offering of FNB products and services.
Their efforts resulted in a safer work environment and the preservation of shareholder value and positions our company for better outcomes as we move into 2021.
We expect the resilient U.S. economy to perform at a higher level as the effect of expected stimulus and the rollout of the vaccine take hold, accelerating business activity and economic growth as we move through the year.
We will continue to serve our constituencies by actively engaging with communities, investing in our dedicated employees, and working continuously to deliver greater shareholder value.
