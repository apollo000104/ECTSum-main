As always, we appreciate your interest in Central Pacific Financial Corp.
The start of 2021 is a very exciting time for Central Pacific.
We are pleased to announce that we have successfully completed our RISE2020 initiative, which positions us extremely well in the current environment and for the future.
We also completed our RISE2020 milestone on digital banking with the new online and mobile banking platforms that launched in the third quarter and the completion of our full ATM network upgrade in the fourth quarter.
This is part of an exciting new brand design that we just launched.
The new brand reflects both the Company's unique history and our bright future ahead.
We had strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020.
While net income was impacted by one-time expenses and higher provisions for credit losses, our core pre-tax pre-provision earnings were solid.
We continue to thoroughly review and regularly monitor our loan portfolio to appropriately manage the credit risk in the pandemic environment.
During the fourth quarter, our total balance of loans on payment deferrals decreased significantly and was down to 3% of total loans, excluding PPP loans at year-end.
Finally, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share and approved a new share repurchase authorization.
The State of Hawaii continues to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are vaccinating our residents as quickly as possible and have worked through the first tier of first responders and frontline medical workers.
We have recently opened two mass vaccination sites in Honolulu, as we move to the next tier, which includes the elderly population.
Our COVID infection rate in the State of Hawaii is currently the second-lowest in the nation on a per capita basis.
The tourism economies remained open with the requirement for a negative COVID test to avoid quarantine.
The daily visitor arrival counts have recently been in the 5,000 to 8,000 range per day, but is still significantly down compared to a year ago.
We are optimistic that with the mass vaccination initiative we will start to see a Hawaii economic recovery in 2021.
At Central Pacific, we continue to operate with the highest standards of health, safety and social distancing.
We've successfully consolidated four branches into neighboring branches in 2020, three of which were in-store branches that had too small of a footprint for adequate social distancing.
We expect to retain customers and deposits from these closed branches as we continue to provide exceptional service at our other branches and through our digital channels.
Much of our back office teams continue to work flexible remote schedules and all employees are required to complete a daily online health questionnaire prior to starting work each day.
We believe the actions we've taken will continue to enable us to provide a safe environment for both our employees and customers.
