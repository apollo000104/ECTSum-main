With that let me turn things over to AAM's Chairman and CEO, David Dauch.
Joining me on the call today are Mike Simonte, AAM's President and Chris May, AAM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
To begin my comments today, I'll review the highlights of our first quarter 2021 results.
Next, I'll touch on some exciting recent business announcements with Ford and REE and lastly, we will discuss the challenges within the supply chain and our financial outlook.
After Chris covers the details of our financial results, we will then open up the call for any questions that you may have.
In the first quarter 2021, AAM delivered solid operating performance and strong cash flow generation.
Although the industry is facing continuity of supply issues, we continue to navigate through these challenges while delivering very strong results.
AAM sales for the first quarter 2021 were $1.43 billion, up approximately 6% compared to $1.34 billion in the first quarter of 2020.
The increase in our revenues on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects the recovery from COVID-19 related industry shutdowns that we experienced last year.
Although North American industry production was down 4% according to the third party estimates, light truck production was up 5% year-over-year and volumes on our core platforms increased 9% year-over-year.
Furthermore, light truck inventory and a number of the key platforms that we support remained extremely low.
Consumer demand for light trucks remained strong and our customers are building them as much and as fast as possible.
We believe the demand environment for these products will continue for an extended period of time.
AAM's adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2021 was $262.9 million or 18.4% of sales.
This margin performance is a first quarter record for AAM.
This compares to $213.3 million last year or 15.9% of sales.
In addition to benefiting from higher production level, our intense focus on optimizing the business and flexing our cost structure to align with the global market demand contributed greatly to our performance in the first quarter of 2021.
AAM's adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter 2021 was $0.57 per share compared to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter.
Our operating performance and commitment to reducing capital spending drove this high level of free cash flow.
Furthermore, we prepaid over $100 million of our term loan in the quarter.
As we have previously stated, we are committed to reducing our debt and strengthen our balance sheet throughout 2021.
On the business front, we are happy to announce that we are providing both air cooled and liquid cooled power transfer units, which are part of our EcoTrac product family, for the all-new Ford Bronco Sport.
This is a great new product offering from Ford that has been very well received in the marketplace.
And as for electrification, we are excited to announce today that AAM and REE Automotive have agreed to jointly develop an exciting new electric propulsion system for e-mobility.
As we shared in our last call, REE Automotive is a leading provider of e-mobility solutions.
The company's core innovation includes integrating traditional vehicle components into the wheel allowing for a flat and modular platform.
AAM's partnership with REE intends to incorporate our lightweight highly efficient next-generation electric drive units which feature fully integrated high speed motors and inverters into REE's highly modular technology that enables a fully flat EV chassis for multiple commercial vehicle applications.
The electric drive units will be developed at AAM's advanced technology and development center here in Detroit.
We are very excited to partner with REE Automotive to bring new e-Mobility technologies to the market.
This is an important step in growing AAM's electric propulsion business and expanding our addressable market.
In addition, our electrification data with multiple OEMs continues to intensify and our technology, engineering, and new product offerings are attracting strong global interest.
2021 will be an exciting year for us in this face.
Our engineering teams in collaboration with our technical partnerships with Inovance and offer engineering are quickly achieving technology advancements for our next generation of products.
On a separate but related matter, we are also pleased to announce today that AAM will receive a grant from the US Department of Energy in support of the development of our three-in-one electric drive unit.
This award further recognizes AAM' technology and innovation to support new energy vehicles.
As for our current generation of electric vehicle products, we are presently in the process of launching multiple new programs globally including components, sub-assemblies, and electric drive units.
These innovations and advancements are allowing AAM to compete to win business with our traditional customer base while also position AAM to win business with new OEM entrants in the space.
We're also very pleased to announce that we recently published our 2020 Sustainability Report.
I'm very proud to say we exceeded our initial sustainability goals this year-this past year and now are in the process of setting even higher goals.
AAM's sustainability program is set by our cultural values and strategic principles as a company that stress teamwork, diversity and inclusion, community involvement, and respect for the environment.
Our sustainability program has become more transparent in consideration of the interest of our shareholders, customers, suppliers, associates, and other stakeholders.
We are deeply committed to profitably growing our business in a way that is sustainable and socially responsible.
Before I transition to Chris, I want to talk about our current operating environment and our financial guidance.
In my 35-year career in the industry, I've never seen such stress on the value chain stemming from shortages in semiconductors, labor, steel, containers, and port delays and the rising commodity prices that we're experiencing.
We believe the second quarter 2021 will be the trough of the semiconductor shortage issue with improvement in the second half of the year.
However, we expect this issue will carry into 2022.
For AAM, we will continue to work with our customers and our extended supply base to protect continuity of supply.
Although there are significant high uncertainty, especially with the availability of semiconductors, we continue to maintain our current financial guidance.
In fact, based on what we know today and assuming our customers continue to prioritize full-size truck production with minimal disruption, we can see a path to the high end of our ranges.
Our current guidance remains as follows: From a revenue standpoint, $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion and an adjusted EBITDA basis, $850 million to $925 million and adjusted free cash flow of $300 million to $400 million.
Operation in our business is running extremely well.
We continue to manage our expenses to improve our operational efficiency and tightly control capital expenditures.
Even with all the pressures we face, we believe 2021 can be an outstanding year for AAM and this has AAM team both very motivated and excited.
I will cover the financial details of our first quarter results with you today.
I will also refer to the earnings slide deck as part of my prepared comments.
So let's begin with sales.
In the first quarter of 2021, AAM sales were $1.43 billion compared to $1.34 billion in the first quarter of 2020.
Slide 8 shows a walk of first quarter 2020 sales to first quarter 2021 sales.
First, we add back the impact of COVID-19 of approximately $169, then we account for the unfavorable impact of the semiconductor shortage which we estimate to be approximately $64 million inside the quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, we are impacted by GM's transition from a rear beam axle to a new lightweight and highly efficient independent rear drive axle for GM's new full-size SUV which impacted sales by about $38 million.
The first quarter of 2021 is the last quarter of this year-over-year impact to occur.
Other volume and mix were negative by $26 million.
Pricing had an unfavorable impact of $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
Metals and FX accounted for an increase in sales of $44 million.
During the last six months, we have continued to see an increase in the primary index related inputs to the metal based materials that we purchase.
You may recall, we hedged this risk by passing with our customers bypassing through the majority of index related changes.
The metal portion of this column reflects these elevated pass-throughs on a year-over-year comparison.
Now, let's move on to profitability.
Gross profit was $227.1 million or 15.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $195.3 million or 14.5% sales in the first quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $262.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 18.4% of sales.
This compares to $213.3 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 15, 9% of sales.
As David mentioned, this was AAM's highest first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in our company's history.
You can see a year-over-year walk down of adjusted EBITDA on Slide 9.
We benefited from the contribution margin on the increase in net sales from last year, but most importantly, we continued our strong cost reduction actions reflecting a year-over-year benefit of $28 million.
Let me now cover SG&A.
SG&A expense including R&D in the first quarter of 2021 was $90 million or 6.3% of sales.
This compares to a similar amount in the first quarter of 2020% or 6.7% of sales.
AAM's R&D spending in the first quarter of 2021 was $32 million compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2020.
AAM has been able to capture an increase in sales with no net increase in SG&A expense.
We will not only continue to focus on controlling our SG&A costs, but also further our investments in key technologies and innovations with an emphasis on electrification.
This emphasis includes an appropriate level of funding to be successful to meet our objectives.
But it also includes shifting resources from traditional product support to new technology development in a very cost effective manner.
Let's move on to interest and taxes.
Net interest expense was $48.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $48.7 million in the first quarter of 2020.
We expect this favorable trend to continue as we benefit from continued debt reduction.
In the first quarter of 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $8.8 million compared to $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2020.
As we continue into 2021, we expect our book effective tax rate to be approximately 20%.
We would expect cash taxes to be in the $30 million to $40 million range for 2021.
Taking all these sales and cost drivers into account, our GAAP net income was $38.6 million or $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a loss of $501.3 million or $4.45 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.57 per share compared to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
Let us now move on to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2021 was $179 million compared to $139 million last year.
Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment for the first quarter was $40 million.
Cash payments for restructuring and acquisition-related activity for the first quarter of 2021 were $23 million.
The cash outflows related to the recovery from the Malvern fire we experienced in September 2020 net of insurance proceeds were $11 million in the quarter.
However, we anticipate the Malvern fire to heavy neutral cash impact for the full year as timing of cash expenditures and cash insurance proceeds align over time.
In total, we would expect $50 million to $65 million in restructuring and acquisition costs in 2021.
This is no change from prior guidance.
Reflecting the impact of this activity, AAM generated adjusted free cash flow of $174.1 million in the first quarter of 2021.
From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter with net debt of %2.8 billion and LTM adjusted EBITDA of $769 million calculating a net leverage ratio of 3.6 times at March 31st.
This continues the trend of a declining leverage ratio and keeps us on track delivering at least internal leverage reduction this year.
Based on AAM's strong free cash in the first quarter of 2021, we prepaid over $100 million on our term loans.
We continue to expect to strengthen AAM's balance sheet by reducing our gross debt and lowering future interest payments.
In fact, subsequent to the end of the first quarter, AAM paid an additional $89 million on our term loans.
Before we move to the Q&A portion of the call, let me close my comments with some thoughts on our 2021 financial outlook.
We are reiterating our targets that we provided on February 12 of this year.
Our outlook encapsulants the best information we currently have regarding customer production schedules, their prioritization of building full-size pickups and SUVs, and the uncertain backdrop related to semiconductors.
As David indicated, based on these inputs and assumptions, we can see a trend to the high end of the guidance ranges we provided.
The strong free cash flow number as a result of focused restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, year-over-year margin growth, working capital optimization, and reduced capital spending.
Our EBITDA in free cash flow generation, we used to fund our R&D programs, support our future growth and reduce leverage is we are very focused on improving our financial profile.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I would expect the second quarter impact related to semiconductors to be greater than the first quarter based on recent customer announcements and supply chain challenges.
AAM continues to lay a solid framework for long-term success in shareholder value.
We continue to invest in electrification to develop highly efficient electric drive units, some assemblies and components that are compelling value to OEMs that will drive our growth.
Our customers continue to award as Business on core platforms that will yield strong cash flows well into the future and AAM we are passionately focused on managing our cost structure, optimizing our performance, and delivering best-in-class results.
At the end of the day, the first quarter of 2021 was a fantastic start to the year.
We also understand there are near-term challenges and uncertainties related to the supply chain that we must manage and navigate, but this management team is confident in addressing these challenges.
We have reserved some time to take questions.
So at this time, please feel free to proceed with any questions you may have.
