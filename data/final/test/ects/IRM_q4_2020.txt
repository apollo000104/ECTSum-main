We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website.
We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, president and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO.
Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, how we continue to execute on Project Summit and the resulting transformation across the organization, how we have accelerated momentum in our data center business, and how we are increasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion and other sustainability initiatives.
In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results.
We have included the reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information.
With that, Bill, would you please begin?
Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well.
As we close out a year, which has been marked by a first quarter, delivering near record growth growth to a remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're also going.
Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the rollout of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macroeconomic landscape.
However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate now, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams.
I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us.
We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open.
We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we have increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million, and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020.
We accelerated our growth in data center with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019.
We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces.
These services led to growth in some of our digital solutions year on year of 8%, excluding FX.
And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in-tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions.
This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers and organizations, in spite of COVID, has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of our growth in the past decade.
This significant investment in innovation and new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers' most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways.
Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center.
In other words, being both the lock and this is key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets.
The strategy is underpinned by our high-performance, customer-obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1,000 companies.
It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit.
This shift in culture is also marked by a singular focus on our customers as our north star; an acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs; and an increase in our commitments to carbon neutrality.
2020 stars continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings in new facilities operating.
Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customers' needs in more creative ways, including processing these unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mail rooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce.
In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most.
What that all means to me is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever, a company with a new sense of momentum that will also fuel both our top and bottom line growth.
For the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum.
If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021.
We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and then expect this to continue.
As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business and believe this growth should continue.
This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine.
One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers.
This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new data center customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as driving much more value from data both physically and digitally.
As a result, you can see, both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a real partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey.
For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers value most.
We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they down and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation.
Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us.
These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform, or CSP, think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and to secure offline storage for a highly secure air gap data storage for cost-effective protection against ransom attacks.
Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas.
In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across three continents since 2017.
And we just announced an agreement, which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through some of our investment in the Web Werks.
The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion, and is growing at over 10% for co-location or retail customers in over 40% for our hyperscale segment.
If you look at fine art storage and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together.
And just two months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business.
They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood.
The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners.
In consumer, we've grown the business in one year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so 3x as big in just 12 months.
The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than $35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year.
I'd note that our segment focus is on valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us strong competitive advantage as well as being a nice submarket, which represents a significant opportunity for future growth.
Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020.
More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of two large financial institutions.
So hopefully, this helps you appreciate now why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond.
Taken together, the seven areas I highlighted earlier represent a significant market opportunity for us.
Let me put some context around that.
If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion.
And on average, those markets had low growth rates.
Over the last five years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market that we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes, $80 billion.
Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate.
So not only has the addressable market for our expanded service has grown by over eight times, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry.
Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020.
At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19.
Throughout the pandemic, we were laser-focused on execution and then controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last 3 quarters of 2020.
This resulted in continued strength in total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% organically.
While service revenue declines continued to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for some currency, and our margin expanded 110 basis points in 2020.
This, all in spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines.
Our success is a reflection of our mountaineers' dedication, and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they also navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home.
Turning now to our physical storage business.
Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter.
Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume.
For the full year, total global organic volume was also flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating.
This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up.
Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially.
For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%.
In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, and we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year over year, excluding FX.
Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue.
This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier.
We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed about $300 million in revenue for the year.
Turning now to our Global Data Center segment.
The team had a phenomenal year, blowing its leasing targets out of the water quarter after quarter.
For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts.
I want to underscore that, that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers.
We had very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail location business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt.
We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1,300 data center customers.
This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments.
We also had this busy year in terms of development with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies increasing our leasable megawatts to 130.
Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand, and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts.
One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into our new fast-growing markets.
The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world.
We are very excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low.
Turning to Project Summit, we generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million, reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions activity and I think -- that actions are early initiatives.
This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021.
As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year, and we are expecting as this -- and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier.
We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiative as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord.
Already then in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction six years sooner than our 2025 commitment.
As we did this while growing our global data center business, one of the most energy-intensive industries in the world.
We will continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the Green Power Pass to our customers.
This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets.
We are confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050 in spite of our very rapidly growing data center business.
To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history, even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas.
And I've never been more proud of how we've behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic.
We also went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embrace new collaboration tools and change how we work.
Our mountaineers truly lived our values day in and day out.
I'm excited to be on this journey with you all, and I can't wait to see the future together.
In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics.
For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange.
Total organic revenue declined 3.3%.
Organic service revenue declined 12.8%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on some of our activity levels.
Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4%, driven by more than 2 points of revenue management.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year on year to $1.48 billion.
Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.6%, representing the best margin performance in the company's history.
Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand this over time.
AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis.
We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures, spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare to peers.
This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital.
To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided this -- our results on both the former and new methodology.
Of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates.
For example, under our former methodology, full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion, which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion.
More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website.
And now turning to our results for the quarter, which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions.
On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8%, which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange.
Total organic revenue declined 3.4%.
Organic service revenue declined 12.1%.
Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends.
Our total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7%, driven by revenue management.
Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition.
We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends, both in storage and service, were better than planned.
Fourth-quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management, and favorable mix, offset by COVID-driven impacts to the business.
AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis, in line with our prior projections.
AFFO reflects an increase in recurring capex that have been deferred earlier in the year in higher cash taxes.
Turning to the segment performance, in the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth, driven by volume growth in our faster-growing markets and revenue management.
This was offset by declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year, leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%.
In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in the paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA.
While there's been a slight step-up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low.
At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021.
We are pleased with the continued momentum in consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth.
Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points, driven by revenue management and the Project Summit.
So, in the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers.
We also had a step-up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior two quarters.
Taking a look at headline numbers for our Global Data Center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts.
Excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts, representing bookings growth of 26%.
Total revenue grew 9% year over year.
In 2021, we expect to lease 25 to 30 megawatts, which, at the midpoint, would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth.
We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation.
We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens.
With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue.
For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond.
Turning to Project Summit, as a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million, of which we delivered $165 million in 2020.
We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022.
This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit.
As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter, we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million, in line with our prior expectations.
In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth capex, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development.
We expect $140 million of recurring capex.
Turning to capital recycling.
In the fourth quarter, our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we have mentioned last quarter.
And for the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million.
I would like to call out the sale-leaseback transaction we announced in December, in which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities, generating gross proceeds of $358 million.
This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%.
This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets while effectively maintaining long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms.
So, on a leverage-neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster-growing areas, including our data center business.
We plan to make these investments in 2021, so our year-end net debt balance reflects these proceeds.
With a highly favorable market backdrop in the strong data center development pipeline, we are planning to continue the -- to recycle industrial assets.
In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling.
Turning to the balance sheet.
At year-end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity.
We ended the year with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, down from 5.7 times at year-end 2019.
The pro forma, excluding the investable proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been just slightly under 5.5 times.
As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times.
For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end.
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April.
As we have said before, we are fully committed to some of our dividend at this sustainable level.
Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid-60s as a percentage of AFFO.
Now to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility.
And for the full-year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion.
At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%.
At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year on year.
We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share.
At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics.
Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive, revenue management will be a significant benefit for us in 2021.
And I will note the majority of our actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter as we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity that's across the year.
In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth as well as Project Summit savings.
Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step-up in cost from prior COVID-driven discretion, rent from some sale-leaseback transactions and innovation spend.
While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter.
And on a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth-quarter results.
In summary, our team is executing well, visibility is improving, and our pipeline across our business has been strengthening over the last several months.
We feel well-positioned as we move into 2021.
I am confident in the team's ability to really continue to build our momentum.
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.
