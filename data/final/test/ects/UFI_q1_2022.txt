So the first quarter results were very good, looking at it from both year-ago comparisons and then to go back to two years ago comparison, pre-COVID.
Revenues were up 39% and versus two years ago, they were up 9%, so the pre-COVID timeframe.
EBITDA grew 119% versus year ago this quarter -- this year and then up 62% versus two years ago, so both give us a strong start for fiscal 2022.
In fact, it gives us confidence to firm up our full year guidance and increase it modestly even after considering the impact of some of these micro -- macro headwinds that we're looking at right now such as labor, raw material increases and supply chain challenges.
So Craig and Eddie will take you through those details in the next few minutes, but here are four trends that we're seeing coming out of the first quarter.
The first one is the diversity of our geographic portfolio, it is a strong positive for us, so this quarter, Brazil and Asia had a very strong Q1.
North America came in right above what we forecasted, but they could have done better.
The labor shortages in the U.S. kept us from producing to demand, and we expect that that headwinds probably going to persist through quarter two.
And then in the second half of the year, we expect to see some improvement in that trend.
Then, I think you can expect North America to start contributing more to our growth.
The second trend coming out of the first quarter was REPREVE sales growth continues to build.
So you look at REPREVE sales versus year ago first quarter was up 39% and then from two years ago, pre-COVID, it was up 27%.
I think, customers right now are continuing to step up their commitment to recycled materials in apparel and footwear and auto and we've had numerous positive customer wins over the last quarter.
The third trend is productivity and the investment in EvoCooler technology and our operation will provide strong long-term productivity and we will begin seeing a little bit of that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.
The production on the current small scale that we rolled out is meeting our expectations in terms of efficiency and output.
And the fourth trend is labor and labor in the U.S. is a challenge right now.
Our manufacturing and HR teams have been working on the obvious fixes such as labor rate and benefits to make sure that we remain competitive in the marketplace.
However, they have discussed -- they discovered several longer term solutions by conducting front line employee round tables in our plants.
We've asked our employees what can we do to make their jobs more fulfilling and to keep them with us for a longer time and they've come up with several very interesting improvements that are pragmatic and they're being implemented, everything from the quality of training and the amount of training to changing the way that the work gets done.
We sometimes forget, I think that the employees that are closest to the action can solve problems probably better than anyone else in the company.
So, we'll share more of this with you in the upcoming quarters.
So all-in-all, a good start to the fiscal year.
There is still a great deal of work to do, but we're optimistic about the outlook.
As Al mentioned, our first quarter fiscal 2022 results surpassed our initial expectations and the strong results reflect the flexibility of our global business model, our strong presence in each region and the hard work and dedication of each and every one of our employees who as we like to say at Unifi are working today for the good of tomorrow.
We continue to be grateful for the daily contributions our employees make to our company and to our customers.
Their commitment to Unifi has allowed us to continue operating a strong business, while navigating the recovery.
On Slide 3, we provide an overview of the quarter and as Al said, we are executing very well, driving growth and proving out how resilient our business model has become.
Q1 revenues were up 6% sequentially, slightly ahead of our expectations and up 39% on a year-over-year basis.
Alongside our focus on meeting customers' expectations, the growing demand for our core products and product lines in each region contributed to the increased revenues, which of course naturally translated into significant year-over-year profit growth.
Despite Q1 exceeding our initial expectations, we had to navigate several cost headwinds and input constraints.
Hiccups in the supply chain from global logistics stoppages and domestic labor shortages placed even more pressure on each business segments.
Despite of these difficulties, our teams' quick actions ensured no meaningful disruptions to our lines of business.
I'll break down our execution as well as some of the challenges we faced during Q1 by region.
In Brazil, the volatility remains post the regional shutdowns that impacted our business in April and May period.
In fiscal Q1, the volatility in the market was driven by the rising freight costs from China, the uncertainty in the exchange rate and the rising cost of textured yarn and Asia, all of which has increased the local market price for textured yarn.
The situation has been compounded by inflation concerns, which are increasing at a pace not seen in several years.
Early indications are this may have some impact on demand.
However, this may actually result in customers consuming more locally produced yarns, which would help us gain market share.
This is something that will remain on our radar as we move through the rest of the fiscal year and we will keep you updated on this.
Despite all of this, as you can see we had another excellent quarter in Brazil.
In the U.S. and Central America during the quarter, we continue the process of catching up with raw material and other cost increases through proactive selling price adjustments.
We have additional work to do in this area as we can already see that polyester and nylon raw material prices are rising as a result of the recent increase in crude oil prices.
While this is a very painful process, it is something our customers are facing too and like us, they are having to pass on their input cost increases to their customers.
In the U.S. specifically, like many other businesses also faced labor challenges.
We see this as an opportunity to become a better employer and are allocating more resources into training and retention.
Fortunately, the elimination of the federal subsidy at the beginning of September has once again brought more people into the workforce, and we are taking advantage of that.
It should be noted that the impacts of COVID are still being felt primarily in our manufacturing plants, resulting in us having to quarantine a number of employees.
Unfortunately, we have also lost a few of our employees to the virus, and our thoughts go out to their families and friends.
Lastly, we have experienced a few delays in the supply -- extended the lead times of certain products, but nothing that is truly disruptive to business.
And in Asia, we experienced a very positive start to the quarter with continued sales increases in our REPREVE brand and other value-added products.
As you are aware, there are some concerns at the Chinese central government label around the energy consumption and air pollution levels and this placed some pressure on the business at the very end of the quarter.
We are seeing minor caution from customers and suppliers who are battling COVID lockdowns and energy cuts.
This situation remains volatile and introduces some uncertainty for the short term.
We do expect to overcome these challenges in the next few months as the demand is usually strong leading up to the Lunar New Year, which this year is at the very beginning of February.
Ascending back to the consolidated business.
It's great to see the progress we have made toward our fiscal 2022 and longer term goals in the face of these multiple headwinds.
We remain committed to maintaining a solid financial position and our current balance sheet provides a strong backbone for us to execute on growth-focused capital allocation priorities.
Beyond the financials, we continue to observe a growing number of customers shifting their commitments to making products using recycled material.
During the first quarter, we shipped more than 23 million hang tags to brand customers.
You will note that on Slide 4, products made with REPREVE fiber comprised 37% net sales, consolidated net sales increasing from 36% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
This growth is regional and is primarily in our Asia, U.S. and Central American revenues.
Our REPREVE momentum into new textile sectors and multiple brand adoptions across Europe has been very strong.
Last month TenCate protective fabrics, a traditional workwear and industrial textiles company from the Netherlands began marketing, it's Tecapro line of workwear using inhibits taking -- REPREVE inhibit taking REPREVE further beyond traditional fashion textiles and into protective wear.
This is the first time our multi-functional REPREVE inhibit value-added combination is being used in flame retardant workwear to add in a sustainable twist to a highly durable products.
TenCate chose REPREVE inhibit for quality, reliability, reputation, traceability and transparency and we've been excited to help them tell the sustainable and flame retardant story through a variety of co-marketing mediums.
REPREVE's strength in the Turkish market continues, with a new line of denim by Mavi jeans.
Mavi jeans launched a nationwide TV commercial that showcases their adoption of recycled polyester in the new line of jeans.
Other recent adoptions by European brands include French brands Jules and the German brands Marc O'Polo, Duke and Street One owned by CBR Fashion Group.
One of Inditex' brands Massimo Dutti has continue to roll out products using REPREVE RO.
In the U.S., we continued to see strong co-marketing in the menswear segment.
Haggar has launched a new line of suit separates in a variety of fits under the name Smart Wash REPREVE suits.
And I know from talking to employees and having direct conversations with them, it's a proud moment when they walk into are Kohl's or JCPenneys or go online and see this iconic U.S. brand shout out their sustainability story, which is based on REPREVE.
Going outside of the apparel market, our placements in the global homes good sector continues, with a new launch of several CD mattresses in Canada that feature REPREVE.
Now turning to our operating segment performance during the first quarter.
I'll provide some high level comments before Craig walks you through more specific details.
Strength in our polyester and nylon segments persisted in the first quarter and benefited from strong sales momentum with robust customer demand.
Our commercial and manufacturing teams have done a tremendous job navigating the headwinds I mentioned previously and we remain optimistic about the sales mix and pricing dynamics going forward for this segment.
The Asia segment demonstrated another strong quarter and volumes increased due to pull through on new and existing customer programs.
Shutdowns and uncertainty in Vietnam and Southeast Asia have not impacted us perhaps as much as other companies since it's a smaller part of that business.
While we do anticipate some soft spots in China based on new temporary shutdown mandates related to managing energy level there, businesses are still running and the demand for sustainable yarns has never been higher.
I'm confident that the teams' continued focus on meeting the ever-increasing sustainability and value-added demands of their customers will help us weather these challenges.
As mentioned by the financial performance, the Brazilian team has continued to do an exceptional job.
During the first quarter, the strong price mix performance increased sales over 50% from the year ago quarter, driving more than 100% increase in gross profit dollars.
Looking forward, we continue to anticipate a degree of moderation in profit from this region with the full year gross margin settling just below 20%.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its final determinations that imports of polyester textured yarn from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are being unfairly sold below their fair value in the U.S. The financing dumping duty deposit rates range from 2% to 56% and are currently in effect.
The next step in these trade cases will be the U.S. International Trade Commission's final determination, which is scheduled for November 30th.
With that, I would call the -- call over to Craig.
The remainder of our financial statement metrics were generally consistent with our expectations as it relates to overall SG&A spending, our effective tax rate and the amount outlaid for capital expenditures and working capital associated with our investments in the business and our strong sales performance.
Consolidated net sales increased 38.5% from $141.5 million to $196 million, primarily due to business recovery we have seen over the last five quarters of sequential sales growth.
For the Polyester segment, the single-digit volume change was muted partially by the labor pool challenges Al and Eddie mentioned earlier.
The price and mix change demonstrates the selling price adjustments that have been made over the last several months in response to rising input costs although we have not fully normalized the portfolio for today's cost levels.
In Asia, the sales volume growth again demonstrates new and existing customer programs that continue to be successful on the REPREVE platform, while higher pricing associated with raw material costs was offset by a greater mix of lower priced products.
In Brazil, momentum surrounding higher pricing and market share continued to benefit revenues, as pricing was up over 50%, driving a significant change in quarterly revenues for that segment.
And nylon exhibited stability with much higher sales and production volumes to start off fiscal 2022.
Turning to Slide 6.
Polyester demonstrated significant gross profit and margin improvement, despite labor inefficiency challenges in the current environment and some pricing lags.
The gross margin increase of 260 basis points is very commendable under today's circumstances.
The Asia segment's volume growth led to a $2.4 million improvement in gross profit as that segment continues its strong year-over-year growth trajectory and remains a significant component of the global commercial model.
In Brazil, our agility against competition and commitment to deliver high value to the market allowed us to maintain strong pricing levels and market share, double gross profit and driving margin improvement of 910 basis points.
Lastly from a segment performance perspective on slide 7 and 8, we've included a two-year GAAP comparison for enhanced understanding of this just completed quarter's performance.
Slide 7 shows the consolidated sales increase of 8.9% from the same quarter two years prior lifted by a healthy combination of volume, pricing and mix across our segments.
Slide 8 provides a gross profit overview for the two-year comparison.
Shown here, the Polyester segment exhibited strength against the previously discussed headwinds.
The Asia segment exhibited a 430 basis point increase in gross margin with recent mix and efficiency gains and the Brazil's segment exceptional performance is highlighted with the comparable doubling of gross profit.
Again, we are pleased with the progress made across our portfolio over the last several quarters.
Moving on to Slide 9, which provides a brief update on our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities.
We continued to have zero borrowings on our ABL revolver, which had an availability of $74 million as of September 26, 2021.
Under our balanced approach to capital allocation, we expect to continue to invest in the business to drive innovation and organic growth, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain opportunistic with share repurchases and M&A opportunities.
Before I pass the call back to Eddie, I'm pleased to announce that Unifi will be hosting an Investor Day event in February 2022.
The event will be hosted by our leadership team at our manufacturing facilities in North Carolina.
We believe it's important for our investors to explore our world-class facilities first hand.
More details will be released on this event in the near future.
However, doing so will mean continuing to remain nimble as we navigate the numerous market dynamics.
These include inflationary pressures, particularly related to the cost of recycled inputs, energy shortages in Asia that have resulted in temporary slowdowns for several of our customers and suppliers, uncertainty related to the continued impact of the pandemic and ongoing labor pool constraints in the U.S. Again, our team has done a tremendous job navigating all these headwinds and I believe they will continue to do so.
We will keep a close eye on all of these issues as we progress through each quarter.
Looking forward, we are excited by recent trends in our REPREVE and other value-added products.
Our expectations remain positive on these developments and will continue to be driven by our innovation and commercial teams and we anticipate them to grow long term.
Our strong performance during the first quarter reflects our regional focus, global commercial model, innovation pipeline and the upside potential each has even when stressed with challenges in the broader market.
For the second quarter that ends in December 2021, we expect net sales to range between $185 million and $190 million and after consideration for seasonally higher SG&A level, some normalization of Brazil segment profitability and recent increase in oil prices, we expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA between $14 million and $15 million.
For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect sales to surpass $750 million, representing a 12% or more increase from fiscal 2021's revenues.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow from the fiscal 2021 level in a range between $65 million and $67 million and our effective tax rate guidance remains in the range of 35% and 40%, while our capital expenditures will range between $40 million and $44 million.
We will continue to focus on partnering with global brands and retail leaders who want to position themselves using sustainable products.
As stated on previous calls, we believe the importance and demand for sustainability will only grow and consumer behavior attest to that.
We remain dedicated to innovating and repositioning the business to drive long-term organic growth.
