Joining me on the call today are Arsen Kitch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Murphy, Chief Financial Officer.
Please note slide two of our supplemental information covering forward looking statements.
On a consolidated basis, the company reported net sales for the first quarter of $426 million and adjusted EBITDA of $54 million.
If you highlights to mention our paperboard business continue to experience strong demand, particularly in our folding carton segment.
Based on that strong demand, we announced and began to implement price increases across our SBS product portfolio.
Our operations were affected by the February cold weather events in the south natural gas curtailments impacted production and increased energy prices.
Collectively, this negatively impacted our adjusted Eva da by approximately $6.5 million are tissue business are lower orders and shipments reflecting overall market trends.
IRI market data showed a nearly 20% decline in overall tissue dollar sales in the first quarter of 2021.
As compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Consumers were destocking their pantries and retailers were working through elevated inventory levels.
With a decrease in demand, our production outpaced sales, resulting in above target inventory levels.
We're taking downtime on our assets to reduce and manage inventories, particularly with today's elevated pull prices.
With regards to our balance sheet, we use the free cash flows generated during the first quarter to reduce our net debt by $21 million.
We're experiencing significant cost inflation at a temporary decrease in tissue demand.
As noted over the previous quarters, we remain focused on our top priorities during COVID the health and safety of our people and safely operating our assets to serve as customers.
Our people's focus has been key to our success, and we will continue to be so in partnership with local health agencies we have offered on site COVID vaccinations across several of our facilities, and we're continuing to offer a $200 incentive to each employee to become vaccinated.
Let's discuss some additional details about both of our businesses.
As you recall, we estimate that approximately two thirds of paperboard demand is derived from products that are more recession resilient, and 1/3 is driven by more economically sensitive or discretionary products.
We continue to observe strengthened demand from our folding carton customers and are starting to see a recovering food service segments.
demand for food packaging products and retail paper plates has remained healthy throughout the pandemic.
We're also pleased with the market reception of our sustainability focus brands of New World Cup and reimagine folding carbon.
Both are playing a role in our favorable market position.
Our strong order book which predates Industry supply disruptions continues to be robust.
We are diligently working to implement the previously announced price increases.
fastmarkets Risi, a third party industry publication has recognized a $50 per ton increase in folding carton and a $20 per ton increase in food service grades and it's March and April publications.
During our fourth quarter earnings call, we noticed that the cold weather event in the style impacted operations at our side percent Arkansas.
This resulted in the $6.5 million direct impact to our adjusted EBITDA.
While there was while the weather event primarily impacted the first quarter, other potentially longer lasting impacts on input costs are included separately in our revised inflation expectations.
As you're aware, we scheduled our largest plant maintenance outage for 2021.
During the second quarter at our Lewiston, Idaho, we recently completed that work and are back up and running.
The overall economic impact on this outage store adjusted Eva dust in the second quarter is projected to be between 21 and $24 million as originally expected.
Our industry view remains largely the same, but I wanted to discuss the inventory overhang from 2020 and the expected temporary impact on volume in 2021.
The market for tissue in the US is traditionally two thirds at home and 1/3 away from home with around 10 million tons per year total demand.
As consumers spent more time at home in 2020, there was a shift toward at home consumption.
Throughout the pandemic, we witnessed consumer pantry loading and retailers responding by placing higher orders with existing suppliers and seeking out tertiary suppliers, both both domestic and international to meet demand.
It is difficult to estimate the level of inventory overhang with consumers and customers as there is no third party data available for this metric.
Based on receipt, tissue ship and data for 2020 and some assumptions on consumption trends.
We estimate that the industry is currently faced with more than a month of excess inventory between consumers and retailers.
While it is difficult to predict the timing for the resolution of the inventory overhang, it is likely that both consumers and retailers are working through much of the excess inventory during the first and second quarters of this year.
We have entered a new phase of the pandemic with consumers starting to return to more normal lifestyles.
This may involve increased the weight from home consumption of tissue, and destocking and consumer pantries.
Based on IRI market data, consumer purchases of tissues slowed considerably in the first quarter, but have now started to recover to pre pandemic levels.
retailers have responded to these trends by managing down their higher inventory levels, reducing their orders to suppliers like us.
This is likely a temporary adjustment after a very robust 12 months of pandemic driven demand.
While the inventory adjustment is temporary, it may result in at home industry tissue shipments dropping to below 2019 levels in 2021.
With that said, we expect long term consumption growth to continue between one to 2% per year.
with private brands continuing to gain share.
Our tissue volume trends in the first quarter and heading into the second quarter appear to reflect these industry dynamics.
We sold 11 point 7 million cases in the first quarter, which was down around 23% and 16% compared to the first and fourth quarters of 2020 and down 5% relative to the first quarter of 2019 sales at 12 point 3 million cases.
We're continuing to closely monitor channel and customer trends to ensure that we're aligned with areas in the market with the highest growth prospects.
Let's turn to our production and inventory levels.
While we did take some acid downtime in the first quarter, our production exceeded sales and inventory levels increased.
We're taking more substantial substantial downtime in the second quarter to reduce inventory levels to get closer to our targets.
While this will have a negative impact on our fixed costs absorption will help us avoid producing excess inventory at today's elevated market poll prices as well as income Supply Chain costs.
As Mike and I discuss our outlook for the second quarter, we will go into some additional detail on actions that we're taking, as we face the normalization, tissue demand and significant cost inflation.
A consolidated company summary income statement shows first quarter as well as the first quarter of 2020.
In the first quarter, our net income was $12 million.
diluted net income per share was 71 cents per share, and adjusted income of 69 cents per share.
The corresponding segment results are on slide seven are pulp and paper board business was impacted by the weather event.
While consumer products are lower demand partly offset by the benefits from the Shelby expansion.
Before we speak in more detail about our divisional performance, I wanted to remind you of some of the changes that we started making last quarter and how we portray our financial purchase.
Previously, we had shown the impact of production volume changes and associated fixed costs leveraging impact in our cost category.
We have modified that approach and are including production volume changes in our volume category.
We believe that this change will enable investors to better understand sales changes as we expect to produce similar quantities of product that we sell, which will all be in the volume category.
In tissue production exceeded sales in the first quarter of 2021.
And the reverse was true in the first quarter of 2020, which complicates comparisons to prior periods.
The cost category will better reflect the changes in raw material input pricing and inflation.
This contract sheeting business as a service and distorts our sales price of our base paperboard products.
Additionally, as a reminder, we have moved our bale pulp sales to external customers back to the producing segment.
from Consumer Products Division to the pulp and paper work division.
We've also started transferring build post from our pulp and paper board division things will better reflect the economics associate accounting changes that taking effect with our first quarter 2021 report we found that retest numbers as part of our 8k associate with our fourth quarter earnings announcement, where we read past the prior three years as well as the past eight quarters.
Slide eight is a year over year adjusted even comparison for pulp and paper board business.
We are implementing the previously announced the price increases in our SPS business and are starting to see some of the benefits relative to a year ago and have a positive shift in our net.
Our sales and production volumes were slightly off due to the impact of the weather event in the south in February.
Our costs were elevated in part due to the weather events slightly offset by lower year over year input costs.
You can review a comparison of our first quarter of 2021 performance relative to fourth quarter 2020 performance on slide 14 in the appendix.
We continue to see the benefits of a positive mix shift due to our shelbie expansion and related commercial news.
Our sales have converted chronics in the first quarter or 11 point 7 million cases representing a unit decline of 23% versus prior year.
Our production of converted product in the quarter was 13 point 5 million cases or down 3% versus the prior year.
This mismatch in sales and production has led to increases in our inventory.
We've had several year over year cost as we've benefited from ramp and our shelving mill and realized benefits from the rationalization and from some lower input and freight costs.
You can review a comparison of our first quarter of 2021 performance relative to the fourth quarter of 2020 on slide 15 in the appendix.
We have also added finished good production and other financial data on a quarterly basis to slide 6510 outlines our capital structure.
we generated approximately 20,000,020 $1 million in free cash flow to reduce our net debt and our liquidity was 282 point 7 million at the end of the first quarter.
We continue to make strides in reducing our net debt and increasing our financial flexibility.
Over the past couple of years, we've worked on our financial flexibility so that we could be well positioned during times of uncertainty in our business.
We prioritize capital allocation, repaying debt and bolstering our liquidity and turning down our debt maturities to Since access to our abl facilities based loosely on accounts receivable, inventory levels and advanced rates, and our term loans covenant life, maintenance financial covenants do not present a material constraint on our financial flexibility.
The net result is that we believe that we have a stable financial structure with ample liquidity and a few years before we have any required principal payments.
Slide 11 provides a perspective on our second quarter outlook and some other key drivers for the full year 2021.
Our expectations assume that we continue to operate our assets without significant COVID related disruptions.
As previously discussed, demand visibility and tissue as well as inflation expectations have and will continue to be challenging and unpredictable for a while.
As we mentioned previously, our pulp and paper for business has been diligently working to implement the previously announced price increases.
We expect that the benefit of this will continue to be reflected in the next couple of quarters.
The planned major maintenance outage at Lewiston in April, which is included in our paperboard business is complete, and it's expected to impact earnings by 21 to $24 million.
Consistent with our initial expectations.
Tissue demand is expected to weaken further from the first quarter shipments of 11 point 7 million cases, as our shipments in April are at 3.1 million cases compared to a monthly average in the first quarter of 2021 a 3.9 million cases to address our elevated inventory levels, and expected lower demand from our customers in the short term.
We are materially reducing production flow anticipated shipments in the second quarter.
To put this into context.
The amount of quote unquote lack of ordered downtime in the second quarter of 2021 is expected to exceed 1/3 of our peak demonstrated production of 15 point 9 million cases in the second quarter of 2020.
The lack of fixed cost absorption and related expenses are expected to be meaningful period cost in the second quarter due to the magnitude of the downtime.
We started observing raw material price inflation in the first quarter and expected to expecting that to accelerate into the second quarter.
We estimate that the impact would be approximately 9 million to $30 million in the second quarter relative to the first quarter.
Due to tissue sales and production declines.
Second quarter out of its costs and higher inflation.
Our second quarter adjusted EBIT dot could be close to breakeven.
While we're not providing specific annual guidance for 2021 there are several drivers assumptions and variables that we'd like to update from our commentary during our fourth quarter call.
We're expecting continued positive impact from the previously announced SBS price increases.
And our paperport business plan major maintenance outage is expected reduce earnings for 2021 compared to 2020 by 25 to $30 million.
Similar to our previous guidance to the impact of the weather events in the south, we've decided to move the Cypress an outage from the fourth quarter into the third quarter.
We've updated this guidance on slide 20, where we broke out the timing by quarter which reflects our current plan and made a negative impact from the weather events in the first quarter of 2021 a 6.5 million.
Previously we spoke to our anticipated tissue buying declines of high single to low double digit percentages year over year.
Considering demand today, we're revising this assumption to mid double digit decline year over year for 2021 as the consumer and retailer pullback has been more significant than anticipated.
While demand forecasting continues to be challenging as the market works through the inventory overhang.
We believe these issues to be temporary nature.
By we're encouraged by our sales pipeline given the pull back and demand across channels than demand ramp from these wins will be delayed.
As customers are working through existing inventory in their supply chains with wider consumer demand.
We're expecting even higher input costs including pulp, packaging, energy and freight versus our previous expectations of 40 to 50 million or revised estimate based on our current assessment of the market to 65 to 75 million of inflation in 2021 versus 2020.
Polk continues to be the main driver.
We're taking various proactive measures to reduce costs, improve sales and manage inventories, which are some will address in his closing remarks.
For the full year 2021.
We're also anticipating the following expect interest expense.
As between 68 and 3536 and $38 million.
We continue to expect depreciation amortization to be between 106 and $110 million.
We have revised our capital expenditure expectations downward from 60 to 65 million to 55 to 16 million.
And our effective tax rate is expected to be 25 to 26%.
And we expect to utilize some of our current tax attributes, which amounts to 16 million to reduce cash taxes.
We did receive approximately 8 million of that 16 million in the first quarter and an additional 3 million in April.
I would like to discuss the actions that we're taking across the company to combat higher inflation and lower tissue demand.
In our paperboard business, we're focused on implementing the previously announced paperboard price increases and maximizing production to meet demand.
In our tissue business, we're working with customers to offset higher costs through previously announced price increases and upcoming product changes.
We have a robust pipeline of new tissue volume and are actively pursuing additional sales opportunities across both businesses, we're working through ways to reduce costs both in the short and long term.
from looking at our network cost structure to optimizing polemics to lower variable costs.
we're managing our cash flows by taking significant downtime across our tissue operation, and a careful slow down and planned capital expenditures in 2021.
At the beginning of the second quarter, we also launched a transformation effort focused on improving our core operations in the medium to long term.
The transformation team is made up of dedicated internal resources supported by top tier consulting firm aimed at achieving the full potential of Clearwater paper over the next several years.
The team is now focused on identifying and evaluating opportunities for improvement across the company.
I look forward to discussing this effort with you in the upcoming quarters.
We have been will continue to take appropriate actions to position our business for the future, while balancing the needs to respond to current market conditions.
Let me remind you of why I think these businesses are well positioned in the long run.
We believe that the key strengths of this business are the following.
First, we operate well invested assets with a geographic footprint enabling us to efficiently serve as customers on both coasts.
We have a diverse customer base, which serves and markets that have largely stable demand.
Second, knocking vertically integrated enables us to focus on independent customers with unparalleled service and quality commitment.
Third, we believe through product and brand development, the business is well positioned to take advantage of trends toward more sustainable packaging and food service products.
Lastly, our paper for business has demonstrated an ability to generate good margins and solid cash flows.
Our Consumer Products Division is a leader within the growing private branded tissue market.
From our vantage point, we believe the key strengths of this business are the following.
First, we have a national footprint with an ability to supply a wide range of product categories and quality tiers, which is an attractive sales proposition to our customer patience is a key differentiator trends away from branded products to private brands.
Private brands issue share in the US rose to over 30% from 18% in 2011.
While these trends are impressive, we're still a long way from where many European countries are for private brands represent over half of total tissue share.
Lastly, tissue with an economically resilient and youth based product.
Historically, demand has not been negatively impacted by economic uncertainty.
After we get beyond the temporary distortions in our tissues supply chain at the retailer and consumer level, we're optimistic that this business will generate meaningful cash flows and returns over the long run.
While we're faced with some headwinds in 2021.
We're building our business to be successful both in the near and long term, and believe that we will come out of point 21 a better operation than where we started.
Our balance sheet is well positioned to support us with strong liquidity, limited financial maintenance covenants, and debt maturities which are a few years away.
We're working with our board to develop a medium to long term capital allocation plan and look forward to sharing those thoughts including internal investments, external investments, and the return of capital to shareholders as we approach our 2.5x target leverage ratio.
