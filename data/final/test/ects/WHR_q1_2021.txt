Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports.
We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations.
We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.
Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.
Before we discuss our first quarter business results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the volatile industry dynamics and our decisive response plan.
In the first quarter, global semiconductors and resin shortages amplified existing supply constraints and thus impacted our product availability.
Further, we all faced the rapidly rising inflationary pressures primarily in steel and resins.
To address these issues, we swiftly responded with necessary actions to protect margins and product availability.
We announced significant cost-based price increase in various countries across the globe, ranging from 5% to 12%.
Additionally, we reset our supply chain model to constraint-driven Nordic, the constantly adjusted production based on component availability.
I strongly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins.
These actions propelled our Q1 results and give us high confidence to significantly increase our full year ongoing earnings per share guidance by 18% to a range of $22.50 to $23.50.
Now turning to our first quarter highlights on slide 5.
We delivered strong revenue growth of 24%, driven by sustained consumer demand and previously announced cost-based pricing actions.
Additionally, we delivered record ongoing EBIT margin of 12.4%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit margins.
Further, we generated positive free cash flow of $132 million as a result of strong earnings and lower working capital levels.
Lastly, we successfully delivered on our long-term gross debt leverage target of 2 times.
Turning to slide 6, we show the drivers of our first quarter EBIT margin.
Price mix delivered 575 basis point of margin expansion, driven by reduced promotions and previously announced cost-based pricing benefits.
Additionally, we delivered margin improvement of 375 basis points from net cost related to a carryover impact of structural cost takeout action and higher volumes as we begin to compare against the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year.
These margin benefits were partially offset by raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins resulting in an unfavorable impact of 225 basis points.
Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and continued currency devaluation in Latin America impacted margins by a combined 125 basis points.
Overall, we're very pleased to be delivering on our long-term EBIT margin commitment and we are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive outstanding results throughout 2021.
Turning to slide 8, I'll review our first quarter regional results.
In North America, we delivered 20% revenue growth driven by continued strong consumer demand in the region.
Additionally, we delivered another quarter of record EBIT margin driven by strong volume growth and the flawless execution of our go-to-market actions.
Lastly, we continued to optimize our supply chain operations, resulting in modest sequential share gains.
The region's outstanding results continue to demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model.
Turning to slide 9, I'll review our first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
Strong demand and share gains in key countries drove a third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in the region.
Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $36 million led by increased revenue and strong cost takeout.
These results again demonstrate the effectiveness of our ongoing strategic actions.
Turning to slide 10, I'll review our first quarter results for our Latin America region.
Net sales increased 18% with revenue growth excluding currency of 35%, led by strong demand across Brazil and Mexico.
The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.5% with continued strong demand and the early impact of cost-based pricing actions offsetting significant currency devaluation.
Turning to slide 11, I'll review our first quarter results for our Asia region.
In Asia, we delivered strong year-over-year net sales growth led by demand across the region and share gains in China.
Additionally, we delivered significant EBIT expansion across both India and China, led by go-to-market and continued cost productivity actions.
However, uncertainty remains as COVID-19 cases continue to surge in India.
Turning to slide 13, Marc and I will discuss our revised full year 2021 guidance.
So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.
We are raising our guidance for net sales growth from 6% to now 13%, and EBIT margin from 9% to now approximately 10%.
In addition, the higher earnings we now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion instead of $1 billion.
Finally, we're also raising our earnings per share guidance significantly to $22.50 to $23.50, by a year-over-year increase of 25%.
Turning to slide 14, we show the drivers of our revised EBIT margin guidance.
We expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by price mix as we continue to be disciplined in our go-to-market strategy and capture the benefits of our previously announced cost-based pricing actions.
We continue to forecast net cost takeout to favorably impact margins by 150 basis points as we realized the carryover benefits of our 2020 cost reduction program and ongoing initiatives.
The global material cost inflation in particular in steel and resins negatively impacted our business by about $1 billion.
We expect cost increases to peak in the third quarter.
Increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America are expected to impact margins by 75 basis points each.
Overall, based on our track record, we are confident in our ability to navigate this uncertain environment and deliver approximately 10% EBIT margin.
Turning to slide 15, we show our updated industry and regional EBIT guidance for the year.
We have slightly increased our global industry expectation to 5%, reflecting the demand strength in North America.
We have updated the EBIT guidance of our North America and Latin America regions to reflect the benefits of pricing actions and continued demand strength.
This brings our EBIT guidance for North America to 15.5% plus and Latin America to approximately 8%.
Lastly, in March, Galanz launched its formal partial tender offer for a majority stake in Whirlpool China.
Our EBIT guidance for Asia assumes Galanz's partial tender offer is successfully closed in the second quarter.
Based on this assumption, we would expect to see approximately seven months of Whirlpool China revenue and EBIT removed from the region's results.
This is approximately $300 million in net sales and approximately $15 million of EBIT loss.
With the deconsolidation of Whirlpool China business and continuation of our profitable India business, we anticipate an increase in Asia's EBIT margin to 5% plus.
Turning to slide 16, we will discuss the drivers of our 2021 free cash flow.
With expectations for stronger top line growth and improved EBIT margins, we increased our cash earnings guidance by $250 million.
From a working capital perspective, we expect to see inventory build throughout the year as we compare against record low levels in 2020 and unlock bottlenecks in our supply chain.
Lastly, we now expect $150 million from the sale of a majority of our shares in Whirlpool China in addition to the continued optimization of our real estate portfolio.
Overall, we now expect to drive free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion or 5.7% of sales, in line with our long-term goal of 6%.
Turning to slide 17, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021.
We continued to expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future.
Additionally, with a clear focus on returning strong levels of cash to shareholders, we increased our dividend for the ninth consecutive year.
Also, we have increased our share buyback program by $2 billion, bringing our remaining authorization to $2.4 billion.
Lastly, we have delivered on our long-term gross debt leverage goal of 2 times.
And let me just recap what you heard over the past few minutes.
We are highly confident in our ability to manage through the supply constraint and cost inflationary environment.
We have consistently demonstrated our ability to be agile, take decisive actions and deliver strong operating results despite challenging market conditions.
I firmly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins, which is once again demonstrated in our record Q1 results.
With increased demand and price mix expectations, we significantly increased our guidance for revenue, EBIT, earnings per share and free cash flow.
Lastly, we remain unwavering in our commitment to drive strong shareholder value and return cash to shareholders.
