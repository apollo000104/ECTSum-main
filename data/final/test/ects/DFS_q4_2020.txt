Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer.
As we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session.
During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question; and if you have a follow-up question, please get back into queue, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.
Our strong fourth quarter results were the capstone to good performance in a very challenging year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model.
While the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood up to these challenges and we are in $799 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full year.
Our fourth quarter results underscore the capital generation of our model.
While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter.
Looking back on the full year, our operating results highlight the strength of our business and the execution of our team.
We proactively adapted to the many ways in which the pandemic has altered our operating environment, including changes in consumer spending patterns, repayment trends and borrowing habits.
Discover has always provided best-in-class customer service and this did not change with the pandemic.
While other issuers faced significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our 100% U.S.-based customer service.
We kept average hold times under five minutes through the trough of the downturn and they quickly returned to normal levels of under one minute.
Additionally, our operational flexibility allowed us to keep our employees safe with nearly all employees continuing to work-from-home since mid-March.
Similarly, our history of conservative credit management and the resilience of our prime customer base positioned us well as we entered this period of economic stress.
We also took quick action at the onset of the pandemic to mitigate credit risk by tightening new account underwriting criteria, reducing promotional rate offers and pulling back on credit line increases, and we added $2.4 billion to reserves as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated.
As expected, the tightening of our underwriting criteria combined with elevated payment rates impacted our loan growth and our total loans decreased 6% year-over-year.
However, we took substantial market share in private student lending and gain share in card lending.
Our digital bank operating model combined with disciplined expense management has historically generated industry-leading efficiency, but in 2020, we took additional action to control costs and delivered on our commitment to cut $400 million from planned expenses despite absorbing several one-time items that have occurred during the year.
Excluding the one-time items, expenses were down nearly 2% year-over-year.
We achieved this while still investing in analytics, automation and core technology capabilities to support long-term growth and efficiency improvement.
For example, we've invested in new analytics to optimize acquisition marketing to our core customers and we enhanced customer engagement through more targeted offers and interactions.
Our payments business was also well positioned heading into last year's sudden economic decline.
Our PULSE debit business had a strong year with volume up 10% from 2019, reflecting the impact of stimulus funds and higher transaction sizes as debit became a critical way of procuring goods during the pandemic.
Our Discover proprietary network was down 2% for the year and exited the fourth quarter at plus 5%, in line with card sales volume.
While Diners Club volume declined, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on global T&E spending, we signed five new international network partners as we continue to expand global acceptance.
As we look into 2021, we believe there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the timing and shape of the economic recovery and some of the impacts from last year's downturn have yet to be fully realized.
For this reason, we anticipate deterioration in our credit performance in the back half of this year.
Nonetheless, we see reasons for optimism.
After bottoming in April, our card sales steadily rebounded throughout the year and returned to growth in the fourth quarter.
We saw improvement across all categories, especially in grocery and retail, which now represent more than half of our sales mix.
This favorable sales trend has also continued into the first half of January.
In this environment, we will remain disciplined on expense management but also committed to making investments for growth and efficiency and anticipate higher marketing expenses relative to 2020 levels.
We also anticipate resuming a more normal pattern of capital return.
Earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.1 billion share repurchase plan and we may begin buybacks as soon as the first quarter, subject to the Federal Reserve's limitations.
In conclusion, 2020 presented us with unparalleled challenges but our business model has well positioned, and I couldn't be more pleased with how the team here at Discover responded.
I'm confident that the actions we took strengthened our business and will drive long-term value for our shareholders and customers.
While there is still uncertainty around the pace of the recovery, I'm optimistic that 2021 will be a better year.
I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.
I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4.
We earned $799 million in net income or $2.59 per share.
These results included several one-time expenses, totaling $137 million.
Excluding these, earnings per share would have been $2.94.
There were a number of factors, both positive and negative, that influenced our performance during the year.
Importantly, our results for 2020 reflect proactive management of our funding and operating cost and our conservative approach to credit management.
These factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes.
However, we're seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest margin.
In the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower loan yield.
This was mostly offset by decreased funding costs driven by lower market rates and management of our deposit costs.
Non-interest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the 5% category this quarter, a one-time write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the year-over-year decrease.
The provision for credit losses was $305 million lower than the prior year due to meaningful improvement in credit performance.
There was no change to reserve levels in the current quarter, whereas the prior year included an $85 million reserve build.
Operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year driven by one-time items related to software write-offs, charges for penalties and restitution, and costs of a voluntary early retirement program.
Compensation expense also contributed to the increase.
These were partially offset by lower marketing costs and decreased professional fees.
Excluding one-time items, expenses were down 4% from the prior year.
Turning to loan growth on Slide 5.
Total loans were down 6% from the prior year driven by a 7% decrease in card receivables.
Lower card receivables were the result of three factors.
First, payment rates continue to be elevated.
While this has reduced loan balances, it has had a favorable impact to credit performance.
Second, promotional balances have continued to decline due to actions we took early in pandemic to tighten credit.
And third, an increase in transactor activity.
Looking at our other lending products.
In student loans, we had a strong peak origination season, increasing market share in leading to 7% loan growth.
Personal loans were down 7% as a result of actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize potential credit losses.
Moving to Slide 6.
Net interest margin continued to improve, up 34 basis points from the prior year and 44 basis points from the prior quarter to 10.63%.
Compared to the third quarter, lower deposit pricing was the primary driver of the improvement in net interest margin.
We cut our online savings rate another 10 basis points from the third quarter as we continue to actively manage funding costs lower.
Online savings rates, 12 month and 24-month CDs are all down to 50 basis points.
Lower interest charge-offs and a favorable mix of promotional rate balances also contributed to the margin expansion from the prior quarter.
These factors offset the impact of the high level of balance sheet liquidity that we are currently carrying.
While this is depressing, our net interest margin today, it should benefit margin as we deploy this liquidity into future loan growth.
Average consumer deposits increased 18% from the prior year.
We continue to see steady demand for our consumer deposit products, which were up $1 billion from the prior quarter.
All of the growth from the third quarter was from indeterminate maturity accounts, which allows us to immediately capture the benefit of deposit rate decreases.
Turning to Slide 7.
We continue to optimize our mix -- our funding mix.
And our goal remains to have 70% to 80% of our funding from deposits.
We also have an opportunity to benefit from higher rate funding maturities over the next couple of years.
Both of these items are expected to benefit net interest margin in future quarters.
Looking at Slide 8.
As Roger noted, we delivered on our commitment to reduce planned expenses by at least $400 million during the year, and I'm pleased to say that we accomplished this goal despite several one-time expense items that occurred in 2020.
Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased $94 million or 8% from the prior year, driven completely by $137 million in one-time expense items.
Excluding these, operating expenses would have been down $43 million or 4% year-over-year.
Yet, even as we remain disciplined on costs, we continue to invest in analytical capabilities that we expect will drive future growth and efficiency improvements.
Looking at some of the individual line items.
Employee compensation was up $57 million or 13%, driven by a one-time item related to a voluntary early retirement program as well as staffing increases in technology and higher average salaries and benefits.
Marketing and business development expense was down $75 million or 32%.
Most of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition as we aligned marketing spend and tightened credit criteria in response to this changing economic environment.
Professional fees decreased $22 million or 10%, mainly driven by lower third-party recovery fees related to courts operating at limited capacity.
On Slide 9, you can see our credit metrics for the quarter.
Once again, credit performance was very strong and total charge-offs below 2.4% and credit card net charge-offs nearly 2.6%.
The card net charge-off rate was 78 basis points lower than the prior year, while the net charge-off dollars were down $180 million or 28%.
Compared to the third quarter, net card charge-off rate declined 82 basis points.
The 30-plus delinquency rate was 55 basis points lower than last year and increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter.
Credit also remained strong in our private student loan portfolio with net charge-offs down 31 basis points year-over-year.
Excluding purchased loans, the 30-plus delinquency rate improved 40 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter.
In our personal loan portfolio, net charge-offs were down 147 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 29 basis points year-over-year.
To wrap up credit, this was another quarter of strong performance across all of our lending products driven by the actions we've taken in underwriting, line management and collections, the resiliency of our prime customer base and the impact of government stimulus.
We believe that losses will increase in the second half of 2021 and into 2022.
However, the timing and magnitude of losses could be impacted by any additional government assistance or material shifts in the economic environment.
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10.
We held allowance flat to the prior quarter.
While the macro environment has improved, the outlook remains uncertain.
Similar to our past approach, we modeled several different economic scenarios.
The primary assumptions in our economic model were a year-end 2021 unemployment rate of about 8% and GDP growth of about 2.7%.
We did not include any additional stimulus beyond what has already been provided to consumers.
Our economic scenarios also consider the increasing number of COVID cases, the timing of the vaccine rollout and the recent increase and unemployment claims.
Turning to Slide 11.
Our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio increased 90 basis points sequentially to 13.1%, remaining above our 10.5% internal target and well above regulatory minimums.
We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share.
Regarding share repurchases, as Roger indicated, earlier this week, we received authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of common stock.
And we intend to begin share buybacks in the first quarter, subject to the Federal Reserve regulatory limitations.
Moving to Slide 12 and some perspectives on how to think about 2021.
We anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year.
We see opportunities for customer acquisition, but the level of growth will be dependent on payment rate trend and the timing and pace of the broad economic recovery.
With respect to our net interest margin, as I previously mentioned, we expect we will continue to see benefits to margin from lower deposit rates and maturity of higher rate funding.
We also remain committed to disciplined expense management and we'll continue to invest to drive profitable long-term growth and efficiency improvement.
This includes increased marketing investments for new customer acquisition as well as investments in advanced analytics and technology capability.
In terms of credit performance, as I've already noted, we expect losses to increase in the second half of 2021 and remain elevated into 2022.
Finally, our capital allocation strategy has not changed, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
In summary, we had a solid fourth quarter with strong credit performance across the portfolio, net interest margin expansion driven by lower funding costs, flat reserves; and excluding one-time items, operating expenses were down year-over-year.
I'm very pleased with our execution throughout 2020 and Discover's efforts to protect employees and provide uninterrupted best-in-class service to our customers.
The quick actions we took at the onset of the pandemic and our investment in core capabilities protected and strengthened the Discover franchise in 2020.
The challenges we faced, demonstrate the resiliency of Discover's digital banking business model; and while uncertainty remains, we are well positioned for growth as our economy continues to recover.
