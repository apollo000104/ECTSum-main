Before beginning, let's take a moment for our usual cautionary reminder.
Such factors can include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policy, competitive pressures and various other risks that are detailed in the Company's SEC reports and filings.
With net sales for Q1 up by over 20% and net income up by a factor of six, I'm pleased with our overall results.
This is a good start to the year and stands in stark contrast to Q1 of 2020 when the global pandemic started.
The bright spot for us was herbicides for corn, soybeans, fruits and vegetables, which recorded an increase of 86% in net sales and 60% increase in gross profit.
We enjoyed sales increases among our corn soil insecticides, however, they were offset by decreased sales in Bidrin, our cotton insecticide, as our customers work through inventories carried over from last year when there was low pest pressure.
Further, our soil fumigants sales declined by about 10%, due largely to water allocation issues in California.
Our non-crop business came on strong led by Dibrom, our mosquito adulticide, pest strips and increased license fees and royalties from our proprietary Envance solutions.
We continue to pursue expansion of the Envance portfolio into additional markets.
In our international business, we continue to see strong performance in Mexico, improvement in Brazil and higher gross margin in Central America.
Also our newly acquired Australian business, AgNova, performed very well and is providing both market access and a level of critical mass to Australia and the Pacific region.
Further, our newly acquired greenhouse business, which features a line of biological solutions for soil health, nutrient uptake and stress tolerance, fits well within our markets in the Americas and Australia and has given us expanded market access into India, China and Europe.
As David will elaborate, we continued to exercise financial discipline over the quarter.
While operating expenses rose on an absolute basis, they dropped as a percentage of sales from -- to 36% from 38% during the comparable quarter, thus we are seeing some economies of scale in our overall operations.
In addition, improved sales enabled us to reduce inventory levels when compared to the first quarter of 2020 despite the addition of the two new businesses.
Our factory overhead absorption was up slightly due largely to the addition of the two greenhouse plants.
We expect the factory efficiency will improve over the course of current year.
Finally, we finished the first quarter of 2021 with borrowing capacity of $51 million as compared to $36 million in the comparable period in 2020.
Next I would like to turn to David for his comments on our financial performance with a focus on matters of particular interest to our investors.
With regard to our public filing, we plan to file our Form 10-Q within the next few days.
As we have noted in previous calls, the Company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries in which we operate.
As a result, throughout 2020 and now into 2021, our customers and suppliers and our employees and operations have all continued more or less without disruption during the pandemic.
With regard to our sales performance for the first quarter of 2021, the Company's net sales increased by 21% to $116 million as compared to net sales of $96 million at this time last year.
Within that overall improvement, our U.S. sales increased by 18% to $72 million and our international sales increased by 27% to $44 million.
International sales accounted for 38% of total net sales as compared to 36% of net sales this time last year.
With regard to gross profit performance, our U.S. crop business recorded lower absolute gross profit on the increased sales.
There are few reasons.
First, we recorded lower manufacturing output compared to this time last year and lower factory recovery as a result.
We believe we will catch up during the balance of the year.
Second, we had lower sales of higher margin products, for example, those products associated with our cotton market and higher sales of some lower margin products.
Our non-crop gross margin approximately doubled as compared to the same quarter of the prior year.
There are two reasons.
First, as Eric mentioned -- has already mentioned, we had improved sales of our U.S. Dibrom products and our pest strips.
And second, we secured an extension to one of our Envance essential oil technology agreements and recorded increased royalties and license fees as a result.
With regard to our first quarter 2021 international sales, we saw increased sales and as a result, increased gross profit.
Half of the improvement was driven by the newly acquired businesses, AgNova in Australia and Agrinos biologicals business, which both generated margins above our international average.
In addition, our other international businesses benefited from an overall favorable mix of sales in the quarter.
Operating expenses for the quarter increased by 13% as compared to the same period of the prior year.
This included the addition of the activities of the two newly acquired businesses, which together accounted for approximately half of the increase.
Other increases included legal expenses, higher incentive compensation accruals linked to business performance and freight costs associated with volume and mix.
Offsetting these increases, we recorded lower marketing expenses and an improved performance on foreign exchange rates than in the comparable quarter of 2020.
Eric covered the sales performance and I followed up with comments on gross margin and operating expenses.
Together, these factors generated operating income that was twice the level reported for the same period of 2020.
From this statement, you can also see that during the first quarter, we recorded a gain on our equity investment in the business called Clean Seed, which has some exciting technology that fits well with our SIMPAS business.
We also recognized in other income the forgiveness of a payroll protection plan loan that we assumed upon the acquisition of the Agrinos biological business out of bankruptcy.
Finally, we recorded $560,000 lower interest expense in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period of 2020.
There were two factors.
First the rate on our loan is down as a result of U.S. policy to stimulate the economy.
And second, we have lower borrowings caused by 12 months of cash generation from our businesses offset by some acquisition activity.
Our income before tax is up 14 times in comparisons last year.
From a tax perspective, we had a very similar base rate for the quarter of 31%.
However, in 2020, we recorded very low taxable income.
And in addition, we have some benefits primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was not available in 2021.
All of these factors came together in the bottom line.
We are reporting $3.1 million, which is a six-fold increase compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Now I want to turn my attention to the balance sheet.
As you can see on this slide, we started 2021 with an improvement of 44% in the cash -- in cash generated by our activities.
Further you can see that working capital increased, which is normal at this point in the Company's annual cycle.
Plus we have two more businesses in 2021 as compared to the same quarter of 2020.
The main driver for the increase in the first quarter relates to accounts receivable.
You can see that in the statement of operations, our sales were up more than $20 million quarter-over-quarter.
As I noted at the start of my remarks, our customers have continued to operate without significant disruption throughout the pandemic.
They are placing orders for our products and making payments when expected.
We continue to monitor accounts receivable performance across our various businesses, both in the U.S. and abroad and can confirm that at this time we continue to experience a pretty stable credit risk position.
At the end of March 2021, our inventories were at $172 million, including about $8 million of inventory related to acquisitions completed since the end of the first quarter of the prior year.
This compares with inventories of $176 million this time last year.
So we feel that we have controlled inventory fairly well during this early phase in the Company's annual cycle.
Our current inventory target for the end of the financial year is $150 million, that compares with $164 million at the end of 2020.
That target is obviously dependent on a few things, including a continued low impact from the pandemic, normal weather patterns and no acquisitions.
With regard to liquidity, as you can see from this chart, we have been consistently moving debt down.
You can see that our position at the end of the first quarter is significantly better than at the end of the first quarter of the prior year.
Availability under the credit line has improved to $51 million at March 31, 2021, as compared to $36 million last year.
Our credit facility is scheduled to terminate in June of 2022 and we are already in discussions with our lead bankers regarding a reset on the facility to ensure that it does not go current at the end of the second quarter of this year.
In summary then, in the first quarter of 2021, we have increased sales by 21%, seen manufacturing output lower than the prior year and taken a higher level of under recovery factory costs as a consequence.
Overall margins have remained in the normal range for the company.
We have managed operating expenses, which increased in absolute terms, but reduced when expressed as a percentage of sales.
Our pre-tax income increased 14 times and net income six times.
From a balance sheet perspective, accounts receivable increased driven by strong sales growth.
Inventories increased, but to a lesser degree than last year including the impact of the addition of the two new businesses.
Debt increase but continues to track below prior year comparative periods.
And finally, availability under the Company's credit facility has improved.
We believe that this performance represents a good start to 2021.
With that, I want to turn to our growth initiatives beginning with our biological businesses.
As we've mentioned in the past, we have assembled multiple product lines globally, offering in soil health and biological solutions for farmers.
Presently, these products generate over $30 million in sales annually for us.
We have intentionally taken this direction in light of the fact that biological markets is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 10%, which is far higher than that of traditional crop protection in a second only to precision ag and projected growth in the ag sector.
Over the past few decades, industry has spent billions of dollars in R&D to develop these solutions, which, at first, were not widely accepted by growers.
However, the tide is turning and growers have increasingly embraced this technology.
Sustainability has become a vital consideration for farmers as farmland is considered their most precious asset.
Growers want to improve yield while ensuring that their soil is healthy both now and for future generations.
We are poised to address growers' demand with the portfolio globally of over 80 bio-solutions that enhance soil health and sustainable agriculture.
Let me now turn to technology and specifically to the subject of how our SIMPAS, Ultimus technology offers an unrivaled solution for the carbon credit market.
First, let me set the stage.
As you know, climate change has become a subject of enormous interest globally.
Along with infrastructure, it is one of the most important pillars of the current U.S. administration.
In the interest of addressing climate change within the ag industry, we have seen a proliferation of carbon credit markets globally, some private, some public, and each with its own set of rules and standards.
Within the past month, The Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2020 was introduced into the U.S. Senate.
Under the act, USDA will become the national authority for certifying both carbon credit programs and for verifiers for compliance with these programs.
Similarly, three days ago, the European Commission published their own guidance on carbon farming in which they stressed the importance of monitoring, reporting and verification or MRV, stating MRV is integral to result based carbon farming schemes as it is the step that quantifies the impact of climate actions that is the result.
In short, governments are moving at a rapid pace to organize and standardize the carbon credit markets and a common theme is that of MRV.
With that background, let me turn to our patented SIMPAS, Ultimus technology and explain why it is ideal solution for the carbon credit market.
The SIMPAS part of the technology is a precision application system that we have described before.
It's variable rate, multiple product dispensing system that enables grower to use only what is needed, precisely where it is needed on the field as per an agronomist prescription.
Further, SIMPAS is not limited to any particular type of input.
It can dispense crop protection products such as insecticides, nematicides, and fungicides as well as biologicals and nutritionals.
This season, planters using our SIMPAS technology will be treating 60,000 to 70,000 acres in the United States using our products alone while strategic partners are testing their own products.
In fact, I will now share a brief video that was shot two weeks ago by Asmus Farm Supply, a leading edge retailer located in Iowa, simultaneously applying insecticide, fungicide and micronutrient through their 24-row SIMPAS system.
Now let's turn to Ultimus, which through the use of RFID tags and our ISO [Phonetic] configured software platform, measures records and verifies the use of crop inputs.
When coupled with the permanent ledger system, such as blockchain, Ultimus record of these activities and transactions becomes immutable.
To demonstrate how SIMPAS, Ultimus can address the carbon credit market, allow me to use a concrete example.
Agrinos makes a product called iNvigorate, which is a consortium of 22 microbials that improve soil health while embracing the roots ability to absorb nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.
Let's say as a part of a carbon credit program, a farmer wants to reduce the use of nitrogen laden synthetic fertilizer.
With SIMPAS, Ultimus, by using iNvigorate and a less than full rate of synthetic fertilizer, the farmer could measure, record and verify the application and present the permanent record to the carbon program authority.
Interestingly, working with the University of Illinois in 2018, Agrinos conducted this very exercise and demonstrated using half rates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer on corn with iNvigorate generates the same yield as a full rate fertilizer alone.
One other point worth mentioning here is that in certain European nations, farmers are already being required to do a pre-plant soil analysis.
If they find a high level of nitrogen in the soil, they're restricted as to how much nitrogen they can add to the field.
SIMPAS, Ultimus and the soil health product like iNvigorate, those farmers could not only ensure compliance with the mandate, but also improve bioavailability of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous to the crop.
Before leaving this topic, I'd like to share a quick video showing our team utilizing the SmartFill apparatus to fill smart cartridges with our zinc micronutrient.
By the way, we have successfully engineered that SmartFill system, so that it can be deployed anywhere globally at a very reasonable cost.
As you can see then, we are unique in offering a comprehensive solution toward advancing sustainable agriculture and addressing climate change.
SIMPAS offers the farmer prescriptive delivery of multiple products for use only where needed and is an ideal platform for delivering soil and plant health products.
And as I mentioned, we offer over 80 biologicals from our own portfolio.
Ultimus completes the picture as a leading MRV technology for the fast-developing carbon credit market.
Turning now to full-year 2021, we are encouraged at what we are seeing in the row crop markets.
After eight years of relative stagnation, which is the longest running down cycle in the century, commodity prices for corn have taken off.
After floundering around three to four orders per bushel, corn has now jumped to $7.50.
Similarly, soybeans have risen from the $8 to $9 range to over $15 per bushel.
These prices should have a positive effect on the farm economy.
Thus, we expect that weather permitting row crop farmers will be inclined to invest in their crops with greater confidence and less restraint than we have seen in the past several years.
Current sales activity for our crop products has been strong during the second quarter.
In order to ensure a reliable supply of products and to respond swiftly to changing market conditions, we continue to invest in our core manufacturing assets.
In this vein, after being offline for several years, we have resumed synthesis of our unique PCNB fungicide product line at our Los Angeles facility.
As you may recall PCNB under the turf side brand, is used for snow mold control and turf applications such as golf courses and under the Block -- Blocker brand to control common scab in potatoes.
This revival will help not only sales performance, but also factory absorption.
On a consolidated basis then, we expect full-year 2021 net sales to increase by low-double digits as compared to those in 2020.
In fact, we reiterate the other measures from this slide, which we presented in our last earnings call with respect to gross margin, operating expenses and the like.
However, we add that we expect our net income growth to be even stronger than that of sales.
In summary, based on Q1, we are off to a strong start and looking forward to a better year.
We will now entertain any questions you may have.
