Both are now available on the Investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com.
First and foremost, I would like to wish all our stakeholders and their loved ones continued health and safety during these truly unprecedented times.
Now that people are starting to get vaccinated, we are optimistic and even hopeful eventually this pandemic will no longer be a threat, lives will return to some kind of normalcy and the economy will recover.
However, at the present time, this pandemic continues to create challenges within our portfolio, particularly for our three theaters, gym's and our Waikiki Beach Walk properties.
As most of you know, all of our properties in Hawaii are owned fee simple and are very valuable.
We have a strong view that post-pandemic, Waikiki will return to normal, pent up tourism returning and every night being like a Friday night.
While this pandemic still remains a threat that we believe we are well prepared to endure a prolonged pandemic with our irreplaceable portfolio, our best-in-class operating platform, our top-notch management team, our disciplined financial strength and a very strong balance sheet.
In such regard, I am extremely proud to announce that our inaugural public offering, which we closed on January 26, 2021, the offering consists of $500 million of 3.38% senior unsecured notes due 2031.
And by the way, it was oversubscribed 4 times.
Success and demand of this bond offering in the midst of a pandemic is truly a testament to our incredible properties, efficient operating portfolio, and our top-notch management team.
Bob will provide more financial details on the bond offering.
Finally, I'd like to mention that the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.28 for the first quarter, an increase of $0.03 from our previous dividend, which we believe is supported by our collection efforts in the fourth quarter, and is an expression of our Board's confidence in the embedded growth of our portfolio that we believe will recover post-pandemic.
As you can see, we're mutually cooperative.
We remain optimistic with the overall performance of our portfolio, even in light of the pandemic, and we are pleased to report that 100% of our properties are currently open and accessible by our tenants in each of our markets.
Of course, we too have felt the bumps along the road like everyone else in our sectors.
Yet, our collections of monthly recurring billings due continued to improve in Q4 over Q3 and Q3 over Q2.
The total collections to-date of approximately 92% in Q4 versus 90% in Q3 and 87% in Q2.
January is currently trending consistent with Q4, just over 91% to-date, and likely to increase further, all despite the headwinds of Governor Newsom shutdown restrictions in California that lasted through most of December and January.
Collections for essential tenants in our retail portfolio, which represent approximately one-third of retail build rents were almost 100% in Q3 and Q4.
And collections for nonessential tenants continued to improve from 69% in Q3 to over 74% in Q4.
Of note, no tenant in our retail portfolio represents more than 2% of our ABR, and less than 6% of our retail portfolio is due to expire in 2021, assuming no exercise of lease options.
And of the approximately 500 tenants in our retail portfolio, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have had 13 retailers file bankruptcy, covering 18 total tenant lease spaces, of which 13 spaces have been assumed or are in the process of being assumed in bankruptcy, which we believe is a testament to us having superior locations that these restructured tenants want to remain in.
Notably, the rejected leases to-date were less than 13,000 square feet in the aggregate.
As you would expect, our primary collection challenges remain in the retail segment with our movie theaters and gym's, as well as many of our retailers at Waikiki Beach Walk, which until mid-October had no incoming tourism to sustain meaningful revenue for our tenants.
So, we believe the pent-up demand for travel to Hawaii is massive.
We expect the tourism to rebound to occur at more deliberate pace until a broader vaccine rollout is achieved, hopefully by this upcoming summer.
In the meantime, we are working with these challenged retailers who historically have been great operators to bridge them through to the recovery.
This is part of our recurring thesis of prioritizing long-term strategic growth over the short term.
Despite the uncertainty, we remain optimistic that we will continue to see sequential improvement spurred by the vaccine's distribution, government stimulus and anticipated pent up travel demand in regions that have yet to fully reopen their economies.
As Ernest mentioned, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through and manage these challenges.
We have been through challenging times before and each time we have emerged stronger, given our long-term focus on high quality, diversified asset base.
We expect this time will be no different.
Last night, we reported fourth quarter and year ended 2020 FFO per share of $0.41 and $1.89 respectively, and fourth quarter and year ended 2020 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.05 and $0.46 respectively.
The lower FFO in the fourth quarter, which is approximately $0.05 lower than the Bloomberg consensus is primarily the result of additional reserves for our theaters, gym's and Waikiki Beach Walk retail.
Nevertheless, we remain optimistic of this portfolio, even in light of the pandemic.
The highlights of this quarter are, one, we have ample liquidity.
As Ernest previously mentioned, we recently completed our inaugural public bond offering.
In the midst of this unprecedented pandemic, we closed on $500 million of 3.38% 10-year senior unsecured notes.
With the proceeds from the offering, we repaid $150 million Senior Guaranteed Notes Series A and repaid the $100 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit.
We expect to use remaining $236 million of proceeds to fund our La Jolla Commons III development in the UTC submarket of San Diego, as well as continue our renovation of One Beach Street in San Francisco, with the remaining amounts for general corporate purposes and potential accretive acquisition opportunities.
At the beginning of this week, we had approximately $380 million of cash on the balance sheet with zero outstanding on our $350 million line of credit.
We chose to access the public debt markets now because of the low treasury yield and strength of the credit markets that we've been seeing during this pandemic.
We had the ability to access the public debt market several years prior to this, but we weren't ready to commit to being a regular issuer on a frequent basis until now.
What's changed is that we have the ability to ladder our existing debt maturities today, so that we have close to, if not more than $400 million in future debt requirements on a recurring basis over an 18 to 24-month period, while at the same time being laser focused on a 5.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA or less.
A conservative balance sheet is very important to us.
During this pandemic, our EBITDA has been challenged, like others with exposure to retail and our hotel, resulting in lower EBITDA.
We believe that our high-quality portfolio and superior close to West Coast locations will begin to return to normal post-pandemic, and our expectation is that our net debt-to-EBITDA will begin working its way back down to 5.5% or less, based on the corporate model that I'm looking at.
Number two, we have embedded contractual growth and cash flow in our office portfolio, with approximately $24 million of in-place growth in just the office cash NOI in '21 and '22.
Number three, our same store cash -- office cash NOI came in at just 3% due to abatements that were provided to our GSA tenants at our First & Main in Portland, Oregon, as part of their lease renewal package during Q1 2020.
These abatements continued through February '21.
Absent these short-term abatements, office same store cash NOI growth in Q4 '20 compared to Q4 '19 would have been approximately 7%.
Number four, multifamily properties incurred mixed results based on their geographic locations.
For our multifamily properties located in Portland, occupancy was down 17% compared to the same quarter last year, while the weighted average monthly base rent increased approximately 1.4%.
For our multifamily properties located in San Diego, occupancy remained stable at approximately the same over the prior year, while the weighted average monthly base rent increased 7.3% over the prior year.
Of note, our occupancy levels in Portland have been trending much higher since the beginning of the year with our recent leasing momentum, bringing optimism that we will return to a more normalized pre-pandemic occupancy level.
Number five, let's talk about guidance.
As previously disclosed, we withdrew our guidance in April 2020, due to the uncertainty that the pandemic would have on our existing guidance, particularly in our mixed use and retail sectors.
Until we have a clear view of the duration of the economic impact and the economy shows signs of recovery, we will refrain from issuing formal guidance.
However, what we can do is provide you a framework on how to think about our portfolio.
We believe that Q4 '20 was close to, if not the bottom of the economic impact for us.
We have taken approximately $18 million in combined bad debt expense reserves in 2020, including turning up most of the straight line rent for which reserves have been taking.
Included in this number is approximately $7.6 million or $0.10 of bad debt expense reserves that were included in our FFO number of $0.41 for Q4 '20.
From my perspective, I believe $0.41 of FFO for Q4 '20 is the bottom.
I would suggest that you conservatively use that as a starting base.
Assume that continues for the first two quarters.
Beginning in Q3 '21, assuming most everyone in America has been vaccinated, I would expect theaters restaurants and especially Waikiki Beach Walk retail and the Embassy Suites Waikiki to begin their recovery.
I would apply some percentage growth to the $0.41 of the Q4 2020 FFO beginning in Q3 '21 and continuing into Q4 '21.
Adjustments that also would need to be made include, in Q1 '21, approximately $0.05 related to the yield maintenance make whole payment on the Series A note prepayment will be a non-recurring expense in Q1 '21.
Also in Q1 '21 through Q4 '21, the additional proceeds from the public bond offering are expected to increase our interest expense by approximately $0.03 per quarter.
As we look beyond '21, we expect to see the following.
First, we expect to see the Embassy Suites Waikiki coming back in full strength in '22, adding approximately another $0.13 of FFO.
Secondly, the Waikiki Beach Walk retail coming back in partial strength in '22, adding approximately another $0.08 of FFO.
Also, in our supplemental this quarter, we have included our estimated development yield for La Jolla Commons III, which is expected to take between 24 and 30 months to develop.
The estimated yield for this development is approximately between 6.5% and 7.5% based on the market conditions today.
We expect this project to be completed by the end of 2023.
A 6.5% yield on $175 million is approximately another $11 million of NOI or $0.14 of FFO.
In the meantime, the cash on the balance sheet earmarked for this development will be a short-term drag on earnings.
And lastly, we expect our One Beach property on the North Waterfront of San Francisco to complete its renovation by the end of 2022, and we expect this property to produce approximately $0.05 plus of FFO upon stabilization in 2023.
For now, this is our informal big picture framework of what we conservatively expect in '21.
But it is not considered or it is not to be considered as formal guidance.
As we have more clarity and conviction on the back half of '21, we will share it with you.
We will continue our best to be as transparent as possible.
At the end of the fourth quarter, net of One Beach, which is under redevelopment, our office portfolio stood at approximately 95% leased, with just under 5% expiring at the end of 2021.
Our top-10 office tenants represents 51.5% of our total office based rent.
Given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located, the technology and life science is the key market drivers and we continue to execute leases at favorable rental rates, delivering continued NOI growth in our office segment even in this challenging environment.
The weighted average base rent increase for the seven renewals completed during the fourth quarter was 5%.
With leases already signed, we have locked in approximately $24 million of NOI growth in our office segment, comprised of approximately $14 million in 2021 and $10 million in 2022.
We anticipate additional NOI growth in 2022 and 2023 through the redevelopments and leasing of 102,000 rentable square feet at One Beach Street in San Francisco and 33,000 rentable square feet at 710 Oregon Square in the Lloyd submarket of Portland.
With the recent entitlements for two blocks at Oregon Square in Portland, we can add up to an additional 555,000 rentable square feet to the portfolio.
However, we continue evaluating market conditions and prospective tenant interest before commencing development of that project.
In the next few months, we will commence construction of Tower 3 at La Jolla Commons, a 213,000 rentable square foot, 11 storey Class A plus office tower in the UTC submarket of San Diego.
With expected completion in Q2 or Q3 of 2023, La Jolla Commons Tower 3 will grow our office portfolio by 6.1%.
We're moving forward because we believe in the long-term fundamentals of the market, especially in UTC.
Direct vacancy remains low at 6.5% and the inventory is aging with just 26% or three out of 22 Class A office buildings being built since 2008, two of which are our own towers at La Jolla Commons.
These 3three newer towers are 97% leased.
The existing office inventory is actually shrinking due to conversion to life science and lab usage in and around UTC.
And record-breaking venture capital is flowing into the region.
San Diego companies raised a record-breaking $2.6 billion of venture capital funding in Q4 of 2020.
The 2020 total reached $5.2 billion.
Life science companies brought in a record $1.8 billion.
The 2020 volume from life science investment reached a record shattering $3.8 billion, and tech investment hit a record high of $762.1 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year.
La Jolla Commons is just a few blocks away from the UTC Mall, which has undergone a $1.2 billion redevelopment, including 90 new tenants and is Westfield's top performing Center.
In the San Diego trolley operations serving UCSD and UTC are expected to begin operations in 2022.
And as for the impact of work-from-home on our portfolio, based upon discussions with many of our tenants, not to mention significant expenditures, our larger tenants are currently investing in their existing spaces.
We expect the impact to be relatively short term in nature.
Beyond our portfolio, even though the tech giants had established long-term work-from-home protocols, they are massively increasing their office footprint by expanding, acquiring buildings and land and leasing significant space across the country, all during COVID.
Facebook has expanded by 2.2 million square feet, Microsoft by 1 million square feet, Amazon by 1.5 million square feet; and Google now plans 3 mixed-use projects on Google owned land, 40 acres in 1.3 million square feet in Mountain View, San Jose and Sunnyvale.
Further, in November, Google bought a 10-acre plot close to its existing campus in Kirkland, Washington, and plans to use it to expand in the area.
Also, Apple just acquired a large land site in Culver City, which is Los Angeles.
for a large office development for at least 1,000 people, at least an additional 336,000 feet in New York City.
In summary, we have a stable office portfolio with a strong tenant roster, no or little near term rollover, significant built in NOI growth and additional upside through repositioning and redevelopment within our existing portfolio, plus substantial new development on sites we already own.
