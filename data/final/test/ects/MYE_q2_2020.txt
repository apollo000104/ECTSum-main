First, I want to say how proud I am of our employees, especially how they pulled together to deliver solid results during a challenging quarter while also staying safe.
Due to the focus and dedication of our teams, we were able to deliver sales and operating results that were better than we had originally expected.
As we noted in today's release, our businesses performed well during the quarter.
We continue to meet our customers' needs, we delivered higher than anticipated sales despite challenges the complexities resulting from the COVID-19 crisis.
Sales in our consumer end market increased significantly year-over-year as a result of higher demand for our fuel containers.
We were also encouraged by the increase in demand that took place in our auto aftermarket sector, once stay at home restrictions were lifted and more vehicles returned to the road.
Our businesses delivered gross margin expansion again this quarter.
Adjusted gross profit margin increased to 36% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with 35% a year ago.
This was due to solid operational execution and favorable price-cost margin, which more than offset the lower sales volume during the quarter.
As a result, of the gross margin expansion and SG&A cost reductions, our operating margin was flat during the quarter despite the 12% decline in sales.
We're also pleased that we generated positive free cash flow of $3.7 million during the quarter.
As a result, our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have significant liquidity to support our operations and our growth initiatives.
Our entire team remains dedicated to staying safe while meeting our customers' needs and profitably growing our businesses.
We remain confident that our company has the financial strength, a high-quality product, and the right growth strategies to emerge as a stronger organization in the future, once this crisis subsides.
Most importantly, our second-quarter performance-as our second quarter performance demonstrates we have an industry-leading team capable of generating strong results even in the most challenging of circumstances.
Net sales for the second quarter were $118 million, a decrease of 12% compared with the second quarter of 2019.
The increases we saw from the fuel container sales in the consumer end market, and the Tuffy acquisition in the distribution segment were more than offset by sales decreases across the rest of our end markets.
Gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 36%, this was primarily due to favorable price-cost margin and lower operating costs.
Our adjusted operating income decreased 14% to $12.3 million for the quarter.
The adjusted operating income margin was flat despite the lower sales volume.
This was the result of the higher gross profit margin, as well as lower adjusted SG&A expenses year-over-year due primarily to lower variable compensation and cost reductions.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.23 compared to $0.27 for the second quarter of 2019.
In the Material Handling segment, net sales decreased by 15.7%.
As anticipated the challenging business environment led to sales declines in the Food and Beverage, vehicle, and industrial end markets.
These declines more than offset large sales increase in the consumer end-market.
However, the lower overall sales volume was partially offset by favorable price-cost margin, a positive sales mix, and lower operating costs.
As a result, the segment's adjusted operating income margin increased to 19.5% compared with 18.3% for the second quarter of last year.
In the Distribution segment, sales decreased 2.2% as the incremental sales from the August 2019 acquisition of Tuffy Manufacturing partially offset a decline in sales across the remainder of the segment.
As Mike mentioned earlier, demand in this end market improved throughout the quarter as stay at home restrictions were lifted, closures eased and more vehicles were on the road.
Consequently, sales during the quarter were better than we had anticipated.
Distribution's adjusted operating income decreased to $1.6 million for the second quarter of this year, compared with $3.3 million a year ago, primarily due to unfavorable sales mix.
This was the result of two factors.
First, an unfavorable product mix due to higher sales of equipment versus consumables during the quarter.
And second, an unfavorable mix of acquisition versus base sales volume.
As a result, the segment's adjusted operating income margin was 4.4% compared with 8.7% for the second quarter of 2019.
Turning to slide six, I'll review our balance sheet and cash flow.
For the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $3.7 million compared with $9.4 million last year.
Working capital as a percent of sales at the end of the second quarter was 9.9%, which was higher than in previous quarters.
The increase in working capital was primarily due to higher accounts receivable and inventory balances due to strong sales in June, and strategic investments in inventory to protect our supply chain during the crisis.
We expect working capital to return to normal levels by the end of the year.
Cash on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $72 million and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times, which is consistent with previous quarters.
It's important to note that this outlook is based on current and projected market conditions, and there is still a lot of uncertainty around these projections.
For the full year, we now anticipate a percentage sales decline in the mid to high single-digit range, which is a slight improvement from our previous expectation of an approximate 10% decline year-over-year.
Now let's review our current outlook for each of the end markets.
Starting with our consumer end market, the increase in demand during the second quarter was even greater than what than we had anticipated.
As a result, we now expect the sales increase in the mid-single digits for the year in this market compared with our previous outlook about low single-digit increase.
In our Food and Beverage end-market we continue to anticipate a mid-single-digit increase in revenue for the full year.
Because last year's demand for seedboxes was unfavorably impacted by a late spring season and customer consolidations.
We anticipate improved demand in the upcoming season which as a reminder, will occur in the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021.
Turning to our vehicle end market while demand in the RV market has begun to improve, we do not anticipate that the second half improvement will be enough to offset the decline in sales that we experienced during the first half of the year.
Additionally, demand in the automotive end market continues to be soft, therefore, as a result of the anticipated full-year decline in both RV and automotive customer sales, we continue to expect vehicle end-market sales to be down double-digits for the full year 2020.
In our industrial end market, we continue to expect a soft demand environment in industrial manufacturing throughout the remainder of the year.
As a result, we have maintained our industrial end market outlook of our percentage to be pretty in the low teens for the full year.
And finally, in our auto aftermarket, because demand begin improving more quickly than we had anticipated once stay at home restrictions were lifted, we are now forecasting sales to decline in the low single-digit range, compared with our previous outlook of our high single-digit decline.
Turning to slide eight, you can see our guidance for 2020.
As I just discussed, we anticipate sales for the full year will be down mid to high single digits, which is a slight improvement over our previous forecast of an approximate 10% decline.
We continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $21 million, net interest expense to be $4 million, a diluted share count of approximately 36 million shares, and capital expenditures to be roughly $15 million.
Lastly, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 26%, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 27%.
And before we take questions, I'd like to close with a few comments.
In the coming months, we'll have a sharp focus on delivering profitable growth and increasing shareholding value.
In our Material Handling segment, we intend to use a disciplined M&A process to acquire businesses that build on our technological strength in plastics manufacturing.
In addition to M&A, we aim to grow organically, building out our commercial, sales, and marketing capabilities.
We are strengthening our teams and our focus in these areas and expect to see positive results in the future.
In Distribution, we will continue to execute our transformation and continuous improvement initiatives.
These include winning new business, growing key accounts, enhancing and expanding our e-commerce platform, and optimizing our supply chain to lower costs, while improving service level.
Focusing on our strategy and driving an execution mindset, we will continue to deliver solid results into the future.
I'm excited to be on this journey and I believe our teams are well-positioned for growth.
