We refer to certain of these risks in our SEC filings.
Participating in today's call with me will be Paul McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Riffee, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Karen Filter, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; Drew Hammond, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer; and Graham Montgomery, Vice President and Head of Research.
We delivered strong second quarter financial performance against the backdrop of the ongoing economic disruption, highlighting the resilience of our portfolio.
As the local economy gradually reopens, our primary focus continues to center around the health and safety of our residents, tenants, employees and their families.
Over the past several months, WashREIT created and implemented a comprehensive reentry plan to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 at our properties.
We connected with our office tenants through personalized outreach to understand their needs and discuss our approach to make sure that they are comfortable with the protocols that we have implemented.
We are fortunate to have not experienced material bad debt to date in alongside reentry planning, we've been diligently working with tenants who have been financially impacted by the economic shutdown to discuss and finalize deferral arrangements.
As of today, we are pleased to report that we have substantially completed that effort.
There is no doubt that these are trying times.
However, we have adjusted to the new demands of today's operating environment and have taken swift and deliberate action to protect and support our residents and tenants.
I could not be more proud of the dedication shown by the WashREIT team during this challenging period.
Furthermore, these times have highlighted the importance of social fairness, equity and justice.
And our company has responded with a refocused commitment to improving diversity, inclusion and belonging within our company and our community and creating long-lasting positive change.
As we enter the second half of the year, we are increasingly confident in the resilience of our region and likewise, our portfolio.
Our Washington metro focus provides economic stability compared to other major metropolitan areas.
This is true both historically and during the current downturn.
As the Washington metro area continues to experience fewer job losses since the pandemic hit than other large metro areas and the U.S. overall.
Washington Metro employment declined 9% during the second quarter compared to over 11% for the U.S. overall.
A recent analysis completed by Delta Associates determined that the Washington multifamily market is better positioned to weather a down cycle than nearly all of the nation's other large metropolitan areas.
This is due in large part to the presence of the federal government and the corresponding stability of the professional business services sector, which together comprised 46% of the D.C. metro economy compared to 25% for the 30 largest metro areas.
Furthermore, our professional business services sector is more heavily weighted toward the professional, scientific and technical subsector, which has fared very well during this crisis and generated year-over-year job growth of 1.6% in June.
This sector is expected to bounce back much quicker than other sectors and continues to be the primary private job creation source in the region over the long term, according to Delta Associates.
Unsurprisingly, the federal government sector has been the least negatively impacted by the pandemic thus far.
Many federal agencies actually received funding a funding boost, which could lead to additional hiring, especially at critical agencies such as the FDA, NIH and FDA.
Government contractors have seen $1.2 billion in contracts awarded year-to-date that are directly tied to the COVID-19 response, according to JLL.
Employment trends for the regional information sector reflect limited disruption and major tech industry investments, including Amazon's HQ2 campus construction and Virginia Tech yard campus.
The Washington metro area led the country in Q2 leasing activity, driven by 1.6 million square feet of positive net absorption in Northern Virginia.
Despite the stay-at-home orders, office leasing activity in Northern Virginia declined only 12% in the second quarter compared to the five-year trailing quarterly average, according to CBRE.
Over half of the leasing activity in Northern Virginia was driven by government contracting services.
Government contractor awards are up 4% year-over-year due to the government's response to COVID-19.
Check and government contracting for 60% of our office leasing volume in Northern Virginia last year.
And looking forward, we expect demand from these sectors to continue to grow.
Unsurprisingly, Washington D.C. office leasing activity has slowed more than it did in Northern Virginia due to lower momentum leading into this downturn.
However, the impact of local job losses for office using sectors in D.C. has been limited.
With no office using sector losing more than 5% of the total workforce during the second quarter, according to BLS data.
Additionally, the number of tours increased substantially in July.
We expect our D.C. office portfolio to act defensively against this backdrop.
Maryland, Virginia and D.C. each took a phased approach to reentry beginning at the end of May.
D.C. and Maryland are currently in Phase two with limited reopenings of shops and restaurants, and Virginia is in Phase 3, which has allowed all retail and public services to resume with social distancing measures in place.
With the implementation of Phase two reentry protocols, we are seeing increased activity across all of our asset classes.
Multifamily touring and application volumes have increased threefold from early April for both our same-store and non-same-store assets and same-store applications are trending above prior year levels.
Following the closure of our leasing office, we took advantage of our virtual touring capabilities and continued leasing in April and May.
And once social distancing requirements were eased locally, we began offering self-guided tours in June.
Just recently, we have opened our multifamily amenities in common areas and started offering in-person tours with additional safety precautions.
Lease-up of Trove continues to progress and is expected to reach stabilized occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2021.
While the economic shutdown has impacted the original expected pace of leases, we averaged approximately 16 leases per month during the second quarter and expect to reach breakeven levels of occupancy by year-end, followed by steady quarterly NOI growth thereafter.
Our total lease rate growth for the quarter was a positive 40 basis points, which, combined with our sequential decline in ending occupancy of less than 80 basis points to our stabilized properties demonstrates the resilience of our value-oriented multifamily portfolio.
Lease rates for our non-same-store portfolio, which includes strong performance from our Class B suburban communities, grew over 2% during the quarter on a blended basis, comprised of 2.6% of renewal lease rate growth and 1% of new lease rate growth.
Our suburban garden-style apartments offer larger unit sizes, open-air hallways and less density compared to mid or high-rise buildings, allowing us to participate in the increasing demand for these qualities over the near-term in the wake of the pandemic.
Over the long term, the expansion of our multifamily portfolio to growing suburban markets in the D.C. metro suburbs positions us to capture an increasing share of regional household formation and job growth.
We began to experience an uptick in utilization at all of our office properties toward the end of the quarter, although, most notably at our Northern Virginia office assets, as Northern Virginia is now in Phase three of reopening.
In preparation for the repopulation of our properties, we prepared a detailed property reentry plan that emphasizes employee and tenant health and well-being as top priorities.
We have reached out to our tenants to discuss the plans and protocols that we have put in place.
The feedback regarding our collaborative approach has been very positive, and in many cases, we strengthened our relationships with our tenants.
We've upgraded our office buildings to ventilation filters, which is the standard for superior commercial office buildings, installed directional safety practice signage, contactless opening technology and proactive shield around front office desk in addition to a variety of other measures taken to facilitate safe reentry.
We have also established enhanced cleaning protocols that include more frequent cleaning and the use of electrostatic cleaning sheets and have developed elevator and common area safety protocols designed to mitigate the risk of virus transmission.
Our tenant experience app, NU, which began rolling out in January, has kept us connected with many of our tenants despite working remotely.
The Concierge program has continued to provide a wide range of on-demand services and partner with local vendors and farmers to provide grocery and other essential deliveries.
We could not have picked a more critical time to roll out this technology to assist our tenants both professionally and personally during this challenging time.
Our Space+ program has allowed us to meet changing tenant needs more efficiently with flexible lease terms.
Our spaces offer tenants quick move-ins all in pricing, flexibility for short and long-term planning as well as privacy and independence, not just for brand building, but now more importantly than ever for control over the health of the tenant's office.
All of our Space+ tenants have control over their own private space, which is becoming increasingly important in this COVID-19 environment.
In an environment where many tenants are moving slower on larger and longer requirements, flexibility is key, and Space+ is playing a crucial role in meeting tenant needs.
We entered 2020, expecting to see sequential quarterly growth, driven by renovation-led value creation and commercial lease commencements.
While the pandemic has disrupted the timing of that growth, our key growth drivers remain intact.
In multifamily, we have positioned our portfolio to retain the growth drivers but we may capture that value for our shareholders as normal activities and opportunities return.
We've allocated capital to Class B properties in submarkets with wider than average gaps between Class A and Class B rents and limited competitive supply, which sets us up for a quick recovery and preserve the value-add rent growth from renovations for the future.
Through our 2019 strategic allocation, we increased our renovation pipeline to over 3,000 units, which represents five years of growth at compelling return on costs.
While most of our portfolio does not directly compete with new supply, deliveries in Northern Virginia, where 80% of our multifamily portfolio is located, are expected to decrease by 24% over the next 12 months.
Furthermore, the pandemic will likely cause delays in projected construction starts in the second half of 2020, which will reduce the number of deliveries in 2022 and into 2023.
And overall, there is an acute housing shortage in the Washington metro region and our in-house research affirms our confidence that growth opportunities are still ahead of us.
We also have a tremendous opportunity for growth, having substantially made the capital outlay for Trove with Phase two delivering in a couple of months.
While the disruption certainly changed the initial pace of lease up, we expect to reach a breakeven occupancy level in the fourth quarter and thereafter achieve quarterly sequential NOI growth through stabilization in 2021 and into 2022.
We in the office portfolio, our embedded growth is comprised of future commencements for high-quality space and value-oriented pricing and move-in ready space with flexible lease terms.
We expect signed leases to continue to occupy, and we expect to benefit from higher occupancy in the fourth quarter and throughout 2021.
Many of our speculative leasing opportunities, for which we had excellent momentum before the pandemic hit, are located in our best assets, including Watergate 600, Arlington Tower and Silverline center as well as our Space+ program, which is positioned well to meet demand in these early, cautious transition months.
While physical touring did pause, it is now resuming, although decision-making remains slower than normal wire entry is being more pure by prospective tenants.
We believe those leasing opportunities are a matter of when, not if, they will commence.
I'll start off by discussing our cash collection performance before reviewing our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2020.
Our multifamily collections continue to be very strong, which is a testament to the resilience of our submarkets and industry mix and lower average rent-to-income ratio of 26%.
We collected over 99% of cash rents during the second quarter and over 99% of contractual rents.
And our rent collections through the first three weeks of July have been strong also.
While we are offering deferred payment programs to residents who've been financially impacted by the pandemic to date, deferrals have been relatively low, representing less than 0.4% of total monthly rental income on average.
Our monthly multifamily collection performance continues to track above national averages.
We collected 99% of cash rents in June compared to 96% per NMHC.
We attribute our outperformance in part to high exposure to industries that have outperformed during this crisis and lower relative exposure to underperforming industries.
The impact of COVID-19 on the Washington metro market has been contained primarily to three sectors, representing approximately 75% of Washington metro job losses.
While the impact has been more broadly spread across a wider range of sectors in the U.S. overall.
As those same three sectors represented less than 60% of total losses nationally through June.
Thus, the U.S. overall is experiencing job losses that are spread across more industries than our region.
The Washington metro market's relative strength reflects the stability in business revenue provided by technology and federal contracting.
We track the industries our residents are employed in, and our exposure is most heavily weighted to the most resilient economic sectors and likewise, less weighted to the industries that have been most impacted, which has resulted in very high collection rates and stable cash flows.
We collected 97% of cash rents during the second quarter and over 99% of contractual rents, which excludes rent that has been deferred.
As of July 22, our collections for July are in line with the same period in June.
Similar to our multifamily resident industry minutes, our office tenants are relatively weighted to the stronger economic sectors than the U.S. overall, which has helped us experience limited bad debt thus far.
We have agreed to defer $1.2 million of rent for office tenants, and we expect to collect over 85% of that deferred rent by year-end 2021 with the balance thereafter.
We believe our efforts to substantially derisk our portfolio by selling all single-tenant office assets and 75% of our prior retail exposure, including all of the power centers, and reallocating that capital to our multifamily portfolio is certainly proving its value in these economic times.
Retail now comprises just 6% of NOI and while retail tenants have struggled the most, we collected 72% of retail rents in the second quarter.
Excluding deferred rent, our collection rate was approximately 90% during the second quarter and 91% during the first three weeks of July.
Year-to-date, we've only incurred approximately $770,000 of bad debt expense related to retail tenants and $638,000 of that was related to covet 2019.
We will continue to monitor their strength and ability as the economy progresses.
We've agreed to defer approximately $1 million of rent for retail tenants, and we expect to collect over 50% of that rent by year-end 2021.
This assumes that our region continues to gradually reopen through year-end.
To date, we've not incurred material bad debts related to COVID-19.
Overall, we have only deferred a small portion of rent and the expected cash NOI impact is less than $0.01 per share through year-end 2021.
While we have possibly experienced the most disruptive part of the pandemic, uncertainty regarding its duration and future impact remains.
We currently believe the second quarter represented the most challenging quarter.
However, future and ongoing economic disruption could result in bad debt greater than what we've incurred to date.
We will continue to monitor future developments and proactively address them as they occur.
Turning to the balance sheet.
We have a strong liquidity position with approximately $530 million of available liquidity as of June 30, and no significant capital commitments for the balance of the year and no remaining maturities in 2020.
As of June 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 6.1 times, at the lower end of our targeted range.
We prepaid our $250 million 4.95% bonds in early April, and we can go to the capital markets to further term out debt when it makes sense to do so.
We expect to remain well within our bank and bond covenants and have access to our mostly undrawn line of credit if needed.
Based on our current projections, we have reduced 2020 assumed capital expenditures for the year by approximately $40 million compared to our initial 2020 guidance.
Included in this amount is almost $30 million of lower assumed capital expenditures and $11 million in less development spending as we no longer expect to break ground on the Riverside development this year.
Our capital expenditure reductions include nonessential building improvements, tenant improvements and leasing costs, perspective of leasing as well as lower multifamily renovation capex.
I our future multifamily renovation pipeline remains intact, although we are suspending the program until after the market disruptions subside.
We plan to allocate the renovation capital at a later date when the market allows for rent increases to deliver the appropriate ROI.
As we navigate through the second half of the year, we will continue to explore opportunities to further reduce nonessential capex spending to further bolster our liquidity.
Looking forward, we feel confident in our ability to execute on our short-term goals of providing payment flexibility to residents and tenants in need while retaining the operational flexibility necessary to execute our long-term goals.
As Paul mentioned, we posted a solid second quarter despite the challenging operating environment.
I will discuss those results before addressing our future outlook.
We reported core FFO of $0.39 per diluted share.
Overall, same-store NOI declined 4.5% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 3.5% on a cash basis, due to the same-store office NOI decline of 4.8% on a GAAP basis and 3.7% on a cash basis as well as bad debt expenses related to COVID-19 of approximately $720,000.
The same-store office NOI decline was driven by expected decline in parking income as well as an increase in bad debt expenses related to COVID-19.
Excluding the decline in parking income and the increase in bad debt expenses compared to our prior 2020 expectations, same-store office NOI would have increased slightly on a year-over-year basis.
Our multifamily same-store NOI increased by 0.7% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 0.8% year-over-year on a cash basis.
The company achieved 40 basis points of blended year-over-year lease rate growth, driven by strong performance from our suburban assets in our non same-store portfolio.
Same-store new lease rates declined by just under 4%, while renewal rates increased by over 1.4%, reflecting blended lease rate decline of approximately 40 basis points.
Non-same-store lease rates grew over 2% during the quarter on a blended basis, comprised of 2.6% of renewal lease rate growth and 1% of new lease rate growth.
Our same-store multifamily portfolio is currently approximately 94% occupied, and our total day bag portfolio is over 94% occupied, a 97% leased.
Same-store NOI decreased in our residual retail centers, which we report as other, by 24.6% on a GAAP basis and 22.1% on a cash basis, driven primarily by higher credit losses, which included amounts to do from tenants impacted by COVID-19, been likely not collectible.
And lower recoveries compared to the prior year period.
The combined write-off impact of COVID-19 in the quarter was approximately $560,000, which included straight-line rents and lease intangibles, and the cash impact was approximately $335,000.
Turning to leasing activity for the quarter, while velocity and touring was hit by the economic shutdown, we signed approximately 20,000 square feet of new office leases and 15,000 square feet of office renewals in the second quarter.
We achieved rental rate increases of 0.8% on a cash basis and negative 2.3% on a cash basis, both for new leases and 19.4% on a GAAP basis and 1.9% on a cash basis for renewals.
The impact of operational cost savings initiatives reduced operating costs by approximately $848,000 during the second quarter, net of tenant recoveries and expense related to preparing our built office buildings for reentry.
Second quarter operational cost savings primarily included reduced utility consumption, lower R&M, security expenses and lower tenant event and amenity expenses relative to our original forecast.
Now I'd like to discuss our financial outlook.
We are now four months into the pandemic.
And while we are not in a position to predict the ongoing magnitude of the pandemic or durability of the recovery, we believe that we are able to forecast subject to certain caveats, the impact of COVID-19 for the balance of 2020 on our NOI and interest expense, exclusive of future bad debt.
Today, I will describe the impacts that we're experiencing on various financial performance metrics.
Our expectations are based on the assumption that the gradual reopening will continue uninterrupted through year-end.
Multifamily occupancy dipped to 94% in June and has remained stable through July.
With the easing of confinement measures and increased staffing in our leasing offices, we've seen touring and application volumes increase substantially.
Total application volumes have increased by 3 times from early April lows, and same-store applications have trended over 30% above prior year levels since the end of May.
We expect the continual increase in leasing volume to drive a gradual increase in occupancy to 95% by year-end.
We did not increase rents on 12-plus month renewals and for the second quarter, which impacted our NOI growth as we normally would be achieving significant rent increases during the strong second quarter leasing season, especially since we had such strong lease rate growth in March.
As a result, we experienced an increase in renewal retention to 60%.
While this higher renewal retention has helped us to maintain occupancy and preserve our seasonal rent roll during these uncertain times, it did not fully offset the impact of occupancy from lower new leasing volumes.
Lower new and renewal lease rate growth as well as lower move in and other fee income were partially offset by operating expense savings initiatives during the second quarter.
The majority of the expected full year impact of operating expense savings related to COVID-19 was recognized in the second quarter.
Excluding the impact of bad debt, we expect the impact of COVID-19 on our multifamily NOI to translate to a reduction of approximately $0.03 per share relative to our initial core FFO guidance for 2020.
Overall, we had previously expected significant multifamily growth in 2020, and that growth is likely now going to be deferred until 2021 and thereafter.
As Paul said, we have a five-year pipeline of value-add renovations once conditions improve and it is appropriate to resume such growth.
And we still expect future NOI growth from TRO, which I will cover next.
Trove is on pace to deliver Phase II in the fourth quarter.
Our lease-up had just begun when social distancing measures drew on-site touring to a haul.
However, we've been successfully converting virtual tours into signed leases.
While virtual touring is having continued success, we expect lease-up to take longer than we have originally guided and will likely to incur a loss of between $600,000 to $700,000 in 2020.
Which translates to a negative impact on core FFO relative to our initial guidance of approximately $0.01 per share.
As Paul also said, we expect to reach breakeven occupancy near this year-end and to reach stabilization in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Therefore, the TRO should not only provide substantial growth in 2021 and but also further year-over-year growth in 2022.
Now moving on to commercial.
Tenant improvement build-outs for near-term lease commencements are expected to continue uninterrupted.
We have over 55,000 square feet, representing approximately 150 basis points of future increased occupancy of signed leases that have not yet written commenced.
Although physical tours had stopped they resume toward the end of the quarter and a substantial increase through July to just below pre COVID-19.
Overall decision-making has been slower as the pace of Phase III entry has, in many cases, allowed prospective tenants more time.
Additionally, we are in lease extension negotiations with a handful of tenants who were previously expected to vacate.
Our previous revenue expectations for 2020 included speculative office lease commencements that have been impacted by the current economic disruption and are now likely to be substantially executed in 2021.
The lease is not signed as of today.
The majority of this leasing was expected to occur during the third and fourth quarters at high-quality spaces across Watergate 600, Silverline Center, Arlington Tower and Space+.
The leasing momentum has been the strongest.
We expect the impact of lower speculative leasing to be only partially offset by higher revenue from lease renewals and extensions.
And we have minimal commercial lease expirations for the remainder of 2020, limiting the downside risk of our internal leasing estimates.
Office lease expirations represent approximately 4% of our office revenues and less than 2% of our overall revenue.
And as many tenants are opting to delay long-term decisions, short-term lease extensions and renewal activity could trend higher as the year progresses.
Parking revenue is down as people are not driving to their offices.
Our current projection of set parking revenue will decline by over $1.3 million over the remainder of the year.
However, that estimate could change if the shutdown is more protracted than we've assumed.
Likewise, once the economy returns, we can experience an increase in parking income from higher utilization as tenant transportation preferences shift away from public transportation.
We are already seeing signs of increased transient parking at many of our properties.
Currently, we are assuming that we may achieve additional operating cost savings of approximately $750,000 for the balance of the year, assuming a gradual increase in office utilization over the remainder of the year.
This amount is net of expenses associated with preparing our bill for reentry and the cost savings that we expect to pass along to our tenants.
Excluding future bad debt, we expect the impact of COVID-19 in our office and other NOI to translate to a negative impact of approximately $0.08 per share relative to our initial core FFO guidance for 2020.
Most of that impact will occur during the second half of the year as we previously expected a ramp-up in that time frame that we now expect to occur throughout 2021.
Offsetting a part of the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business is a reduction in our expectations for interest expense by $0.04 per share relative to our initial core FFO 2020 guidance, excluding any future refinancings to further term out debt.
On a combined basis, we expect the impact of COVID-19 on NOI and interest expense to translate to a negative impact of approximately $0.08 per share relative to our initial guidance for 2020.
We are not updating other guidance assumptions at this time.
The majority of the impact will occur during the second half of the year as we previously expected a ramp-up in that time frame that we now have expected to incur throughout 2021.
Overall, we're actually slightly ahead of our original budget for the first six months of 2020, despite going through a historically challenging four-month period.
As we just explained, much of the growth we had planned for the second half of 2020 appears to be deferred, but we believe still intact for the future.
In closing, while we are operating in a challenging environment, we are confident in our ability to effectively manage through this period of uncertainty while preserving the embedded growth of our assets.
Our value-oriented portfolio has demonstrated resilience as we absorb the near-term impact, which is further underscored by our strong rent collection performance and the proven stability of the Washington metro economy.
Furthermore, our sustained multifamily lease rate growth and stabilizing occupancy trends highlight the value of our research-driven capital allocation strategy, which has led us to invest in well-located residential units that will be in the path of growth once the economy resumes.
