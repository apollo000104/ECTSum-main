As Jonathan said, this is Todd Leombruno, chief financial officer speaking.
I'd like to direct you to Slide No.
Reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's materials.
As usual, today, Tom is going to begin with highlights of the quarter and a few comments on the company's transformation.
Two comments before we begin today.
First, as a reminder, regarding the pending Meggitt acquisition, we are still bound by the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code in respect to discussing certain transaction details.
And secondly, we are announcing a date and time change to our upcoming virtual investor day due to a scheduling conflict with another company's investor day.
Our meeting will now be held on Tuesday, March 8 from 9 am to 12 pm Eastern.
It will be a virtual event.
And among the topics that we'll cover will be the release of our new long-term financial targets.
I want to start with the title of this slide, which is exceptional execution in a challenging environment.
When you look at the performance of the company in aggregate, safety, sales growth, the margin expansion, EPS, it was an extremely strong quarter.
This is against arguably one of the most difficult operating environments that we've all faced in our careers when you add up the cumulative effect of inflation, supply chain challenges and the Omicron virus.
Let's start with the first bullet.
Focus on safety continues.
It is our No.
We're leveraging our high-performance teams, the combination of the natural work teams that we have in our plants and warehouses as well as the Star Point teams and Kaizen.
And it's really this combination, this team structure plus Kaizen, that is driving an ownership culture within the company.
So ownership of safety, but also ownership of quality, cost, delivery and engagement.
Sales growth was 12% year over year.
Organic growth was 13%.
It was nice across all the external reporting segments as well as every region participating.
Total sales was a second quarter record as well as total segment operating margin.
EBITDA margin was 18.2% as reported or 22.7% adjusted.
It was 180 basis points.
It's a big move versus prior year.
Robust demand environment continues.
We had over 90% of our end markets in the growth phase, which we're very excited about.
And this execution, what you're seeing, is really the cumulative effect of win strategy 2.0 and 3.0 driving this kind of performance.
When you add the strategy changes on top of the portfolio, things we've done, adding those great acquisitions that we've done over the last number of years and the powerful secular trends that I'm going to talk about here momentarily, we see the future has much longer cycle and more resilient and faster growing.
So if you go to the next slide, Slide 4, I've touched on this before.
This kind of frames all of our thinking and our strategies for the company to around trying to achieve these three key drivers.
Living up to our purpose, that higher calling, that North Star that we're driving for, to be great generators and deployers of cash, to be a top quartile performer versus our proxy peers.
If you go to Slide 5, which is the little expression that a picture is worth a thousand words, this kind of sums up how the company has changed over the last number of years.
We've updated this slide for FY '22 numbers.
And I'm going to just reframe this slide for you.
On the left-hand side is adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and on the right-hand side is adjusted EBITDA margin.
So if you look on the left and you go to FY '16, so we worked real hard as a company for 100 years to get to $6.99 EPS.
And then the last six years, we've grown it by 2.5x to a little over $18 in our current guide.
If you just look at the gain that we've had since the pandemic, FY '20 to FY '22 guide, it's almost another $6 just in those two years.
It happens to be and I don't think it's coincidental, that we launched win strategy 3.0 at the beginning of FY '20.
And you can see what it's done to propel performance.
If you look on the right-hand side and we don't guide on EBITDA margin, but we put in our EBITDA margin year to date to 22.4%.
If you look at that from FY '16 to that, it's 770 basis points improvement, just remarkable improvement.
Really the how behind these results, it's been our people, portfolio changes that we've done and has been, again, a cumulative effect of win strategy 2.0, 3.0.
So if you go to the next slide, give you a quick update on the Meggitt transaction.
We continue to make progress.
There's really four main work streams that we're working.
There's two, the economic and national security review that we're working on with the U.K. government.
I would characterize those as constructive and positive and on track.
And then the antitrust and FDI filings are proceeding as we had anticipated.
We're still anticipating a Q3 calendar 2022 close and we're really excited about this.
This is obviously a compelling combination.
It doubles the size of our aerospace business, highly complementary technologies.
And we're at the beginning of a commercial aerospace recovery with great synergies as we put these two companies together.
Again, coming -- bringing this on with everything else we've been doing, a much longer cycle, less cyclical, faster growing company.
And then on Slide 7, in addition to the strategic acquisitions that we've been making, we are uniquely positioned with our eight motion and control technologies to benefit from the four secular trends that you see on this page.
Now I touched on aerospace and the recovery and momentum of Meggitt plus Parker.
But if you look at electrification, ESG, digitization, what you have here are long-term multiyear growth enablers and content growth for us is going to grow, both onboard as well as infrastructure.
And we're excited that this is going to be a big part of what we'll talk about at investor day and we look forward to sharing more about these secular trends on March 8 with you.
I'll ask everyone to move to Slide 9 and I'll start with our FY '22 Q2 results.
As Tom mentioned, this was just an outstanding quarter.
Just another reminder that our operations leaders are really driving the company to significantly higher levels of performance.
Our sales increased 12% versus the prior year.
We did hit a record level of $3.8 billion.
Tom mentioned this, but organic sales were very healthy at 13%.
Currency was about a one point drag on sales.
That's how we got to the 12% reported sales increase.
Demand just remains robust.
Our backlogs are healthy.
Growth remains very broad-based across all of our industrial businesses.
If you look into the aerospace business, commercial demand continues to trend positive.
And we talked about this before, but the acquisitions of CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic continue to outperform our expectations.
When you look at the segment operating margins, it's a Q2 record on an adjusted basis.
We did 21.6% segment operating margin.
That's 120 basis points improvement from prior year.
And our teams are really managing through the well documented supply chain issues, the inflationary environment.
I really just want to commend them on our team's swift actions to manage these costs and inflationary actions, still while achieving record sales in the quarter.
Tom mentioned this, but adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.7%.
That's up 180 basis points from last year.
Both our adjusted net income and our adjusted earnings per share has improved by 29% versus prior year.
Net income is $582 million or 15.2% return on sales.
And adjusted earnings per share was $4.46.
That's $1.01 increase versus the prior year of $3.45, just a really solid quarter.
If we jump to Slide 10.
This is just a bridge on adjusted earnings per share and I'll just detail some of the components that generated the $1.01 increase in EPS.
And as you can see really, operating execution is the major driver in this increase.
Adjusted segment operating income did increase by $132 million.
That's 19% greater than prior year.
And that really accounts for 80% of the increase in our earnings per share this quarter.
We did have some other favorable items that was $0.19 favorable.
There were some currency gains that were favorable.
We did sell a few facilities that we restructured.
Those closed in the quarter.
And we do have reduced pension expense versus prior year.
All of that added up to $0.19.
And then you could see the other items on the slide that all netted to $0.04 favorable.
But really, the story here is just a very strong operating quarter.
If we go to Slide 11, I'll make a few comments on our segment performance.
Tom mentioned those secular trends.
We are seeing growth from those trends across our segments.
Every single one of the segments has a record adjusted segment operating margin this quarter.
We did maintain a cost-price neutral position.
We're very proud of that.
Incrementals were 32% versus prior year.
And I just want to remind everybody, that is against a headwind of $65 million of discretionary savings that we had in the prior year.
If you exclude those discretionary savings, our incrementals were 48%.
So really fantastic performance across the board from our teams.
It really highlights the power of the win strategy and really demonstrates our ability to perform through this current climate.
If you look at orders, orders are plus 12 and really the demand continues to be robust across our businesses.
Just a little color on Diversified Industrial North America, sales reached $1.8 billion.
Organic growth in that segment was 15% versus prior year.
And listen, we're really pleased with the performance in this region.
We've talked a lot -- I've read -- I know everyone is familiar with the well documented supply chain issues.
Tom mentioned the Omicron spike.
We are not immune to that.
But we did keep operating margins at a very high level of 21.3% in this segment and we're proud of that.
Order rates continued to be very high at plus 17.
Our backlog is strong.
And Tom mentioned this, 91% of our markets are in growth mode.
So great things in the North American businesses.
Industrial international is a great story.
Sales are $1.4 billion.
Organic growth is up 14% in this segment.
And I want to note that across all the regions within our International segment, organic growth was mid-teen positive in every region.
So really robust activity there.
Maybe more impressive is the adjusted operating margins, 22.4%.
This is an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year.
And certainly, we have volume.
We've talked a lot about our growth in distribution internationally.
We are benefiting from some product mix.
And really, the team is doing a great job controlling cost.
And this has been a really long-term effort over a long period of time from that team.
So I'm really happy that they're able to put up these continued high level of margin performance.
Order rates there were plus 14%, ample backlog and really solid international performance.
If we look at aerospace systems, really continued signs of a rebound there.
Sale were $618 million.
Organic sales are positive at almost 6%.
And we did see very strong demand in our commercial OEM and MRO markets.
Great margin performance here as well.
Operating margins have increased 270 basis points that finished the quarter at 20.7%.
And again, I just want to remind everyone that, that is still at pre-COVID volume levels.
So great margin performance from our aerospace team.
Aerospace orders on a 12-month rolling rate did decline 7%.
But one item I want to make clear for everybody is we did have a few large multiyear military orders in the prior period that really created a tough comp just in aerospace.
If we exclude those orders, aerospace orders would be plus mid-teens positive.
So we're seeing continued signs of steady improvement in aerospace.
Our order dollars in aerospace in the quarter were at the highest level they've been in the last three quarters.
So great quarter out of aerospace.
But if you really look at the segments, it's really outstanding operating performance.
We've got positive growth, strong order dollars, robust backlogs, record margins and really just solid execution across the board.
So great segment performance.
If I take you to Slide 12 and talk about cash flow on a year-to-date basis, we did exceed $1 billion in cash flow from operations.
That is 13.3% of sales.
Free cash flow is $900 million or almost 12% of sales.
And conversion on a year-to-date basis is now 107%.
We still continue to diligently manage working capital across the company.
We really are just responding to these increased demand levels that we have.
The working capital change did improve in the quarter as we forecasted.
In the quarter, it was a 1.9% use of cash.
Versus last year, it was a 4.1% source of cash.
So for the full year, I just want to reiterate, we continue to forecast mid-teens cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the full year will exceed 100%.
If we go to Slide 13 now, I just want to make a few comments on our capital deployment activity.
I'm sure many people have seen this, but last week, our board approved a dividend declaration of $1.03 per share.
That is fully supportive of our long-standing 65-year record of increasing dividends paid.
And I want to give an update on the Meggitt financing.
We continue to make progress on our financing plan.
Our plan is flexible.
I did mention on the last call that we secured a deal contingent forward hedge contract in the amount of GBP 6.4 billion.
Accounting rules require us to mark those contracts to market.
That impact in the quarter was a non-cash charge of $149 million.
We booked that in the other expense line and we are treating that as an adjusted item.
We now have $2.5 billion of cash deposited in escrow to fund the Meggitt transaction.
That is listed on our balance sheet as restricted cash.
And that was funded from a combination of commercial paper and some cash on hand.
A result of that, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ended up being 2.7 times in the quarter.
Net debt was 2.5 times.
If you account for the $2.5 billion of restricted cash, net debt-to-EBITDA would be 1.8.
Full year adjusted earnings per share is raised by $0.75.
We did guide to $17.30 at the midpoint last quarter.
We have moved that to $18.05 and that is at the midpoint.
We've also narrowed the range.
Range is now $0.25, up or down.
And sales is also raised.
We're raising the midpoint to a range of 10% at the midpoint.
We've got a range of 9% to 11%.
And the breakdown of that sales change at the midpoint is organic growth is 10 and a half percent.
Currency will be about one point unfavorable.
And of course, there's no impact from acquisitions.
As Tom said, we don't expect Meggitt to close in our fiscal year.
If we look at the full year adjusted segment operating margin, we're also raising that 20 basis points from the prior guide.
Full year now, we expect that to be 22.1% at the midpoint.
There is a 20 basis point range on either side of that.
And corporate G&A and other is expected to be $656 million on an as reported basis, but $435 million on an adjusted basis.
So of course, there's a couple of adjusted items in there.
The acquisition-related intangible assets, that is a standard adjustment, the realignment expenses standard adjustment, the lowered cost to achieve standard adjustment.
But we are adjusting these transaction-related expenses for Meggitt.
Year to date, we've got $71 million worth of transaction costs and of course, that $149 million non-cash mark-to-market loss that I just mentioned.
We're going to continue to adjust for the transaction-related expenses as they are incurred.
If you look at tax rate, tax rate is now going to be slightly lower than what we had forecasted just based on first half activity.
We expect that to be 22% now.
And finally, guidance for the full year assumed sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share all split, 48% first half, 52% in the second half.
And just a little bit more color, Q3, FY '22 Q3 adjusted earnings per share guide, we have at $4.54.
So with that, Tom, I'll hand it back to you for closing comments and I'll ask everyone to go to Slide 15.
We've got a highly engaged team around the world living up to our purpose, which is enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow.
You've seen what 3.0 has done, as I referenced in that earnings per share chart, describing our current performance that's going to drive our future performance.
It's the early days of win strategy 3.0 and I would characterize it as having long legs, lots of potential ahead with win strategy 3.0.
The portfolio transformation continues.
We've acquired three great companies, are in the process of a fourth that will make us longer cycle and more resilient.
And if you put that on top of the secular trends that I highlighted, we feel very, very positive about the future.
So it's been our portfolio changes.
It's been the strategy changes.
But it really starts with our people, 55,000 team members that are thinking and acting like an owner, so 55,000 owners that are driving this transformation.
And then I'm going to hand it back to Todd for a quick comment just to set up the Q&A before we get started.
Jonathan, I just want to want to ask the participants of the call just as a reminder to ask one question, follow up if needed and then jump back into the queue just so we can try to get everyone on the call to to have a shot at answering a question.
We do appreciate your cooperation.
