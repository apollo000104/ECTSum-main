That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.
Let me start with the headlines for the quarter.
Organic sales increased 3% with good underlying momentum and benefits from increased demand related to COVID-19.
We significantly increased our growth investments and improved our market positions.
We had another strong quarter of achieving cost savings and returning cash to shareholders.
And finally, while earnings were down as expected, we are increasing our full-year outlook.
Now let's look at the details of our results, starting with sales.
Our third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion.
That's up 1% from year ago and includes a two-point drag from currency rates.
Volumes were up 2% and the combined impact of changes in net selling prices and product mix increased sales by 1%.
By segment, organic sales rose 10% in Consumer Tissue and 5% in Personal Care, but declined 15% in K-C Professional.
Mike will talk more about our top-line and our market share performance in just a few minutes.
Moving on to profitability.
Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.2%, up 40 basis points year-on-year.
Adjusted gross profit increased 2%.
We had excellent cost savings performance in the quarter.
Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs totaled $140 million, including continued strong productivity improvements.
Commodities were a benefit of $25 million in the quarter driven by pulp and other raw materials.
Other manufacturing costs were higher year-on-year that included incremental costs related to COVID-19.
Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a high single digit rate in the quarter.
Moving further down the P&L.
Between the lines spending was 18.9% of sales.
That's up 180 basis points and driven by a big step up in digital advertising.
G&A also increased including capability-building investments and higher incentive compensation expenses.
We expect between the lines spending will rise further sequentially in the fourth quarter.
Our SG&A spending is typically high in the fourth quarter and this year we'll also have project activities that were temporarily delayed because of COVID-19.
All in all, for the fourth quarter-for the third quarter, sorry, adjusted operating profit was down 6% and operating margin was 17.2%, down 130 basis points versus year ago.
By segment, operating margins were up in Consumer Tissue and Healthy and Personal Care.
K-C Professional margins were down significantly, including an approximate 600 basis-point drag from fixed costs under absorption.
On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 in the quarter, compared to $1.84 in the year-ago period.
Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency.
Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $559 million compared to $886 million in the year-ago quarter.
The decrease was as expected and driven by the timing of tax payments and higher working capital.
We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.
Third quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $560 million.
And for the full year, we expect the total will be $2.15 billion.
So let me now turn to the full year.
The overall headline is that we're raising our top and bottom-line outlook.
On the top-line, we now expect organic sales growth of 5% compared to our prior target of 4% to 5%.
Through nine months, organic sales are up nearly 6% and we expect a solid fourth quarter.
On average, we expect slightly less headwinds from currency rates than previously anticipated.
In addition, we'll begin consolidating the Softex Indonesia business into our results on November 1 on a one-month lag.
All in all, we expect net sales will grow 2% to 3% this year.
That's one point better than our previous estimate.
On the bottom-line, our new outlook is for adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 to $7.65.
That represents year-on-year growth of 9% to 11%.
Our prior outlook was for adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60.
The increase in our outlook is driven by improved top line, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and other manufacturing costs.
Overall, I'm encouraged that we're improving our near-term outlook and investing significantly in the business for longer-term growth.
I'll begin by reinforcing that we remain focused on three near-term priorities that we established since the outbreak of COVID-19.
First, we're focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and our consumers.
Second, we're proactively managing our supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products.
And third, we're prudently managing the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly Clark.
Our 40,000 employees continue to do heroic work in this COVID environment.
Our supply chain operations have remained online with strong productivity gains and fewer COVID-related disruptions over the last three months.
The environment is still dynamic and we're closely monitoring virus hotspots.
And thus far, our supply chain has been resilient and our teams have done a great job overcoming daily challenges.
Now turn to our results focusing on organic sales category conditions and our market shares.
As Maria mentioned, organic sales increased 3% in the quarter.
In North American consumer products, organics sales rose 8%.
Now within that Personal Care grew 6% driven by broad-based volume growth in baby and child care.
We improved our market shares on diapers, baby wipes, and in child care.
In late July, we launched Pull-Ups New Leaf training pants which features super-soft natural materials and is our most premium training pants.
This is another example of our elevate the core strategy and action.
And New Leaf is off to a very good start.
In North American consumer tissue, organic sales increased to 11% and that reflects strong demand due to the COVID-19 work from home environment and strong momentum on Kleenex facial tissue.
Bathroom tissue shipments benefited from our efforts to restore customer inventory levels.
In the fourth quarter, we expect more benefit from those efforts and from people continuing to spend more time at home.
Our market share performance in North American consumer products was strong in the third quarter; shares were upper even in six of eight categories.
Turning to K-C Professional North America, organic sales declined 15%.
Sales were down about 35% in washroom products.
And as you'd expect, the category has been significantly impacted.
There are fewer people working in offices and lower levels of business activity, including in travel and lodging.
Sales were a bit better in September, but we're planning for only a modest near-term improvement in the environment.
On the other hand, KCP sales were up double digits in wipers, safety and other products.
Our efforts to expand our face mask business by leveraging our superior non-wovens technology is off to a good start.
We're also expanding our wipers line-up with Scott 24-Hour, which delivers long-lasting surface protection from bacteria.
Moving to D&E markets, organic sales were up 2% that was driven by 7% growth in Personal Care.
In terms of key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China, mid-single digits in both Latin America and Eastern Europe and strong double-digits in India.
Organic sales were down mid-single digits in ASEAN.
We also improved our market shares in many countries in the quarter.
And that includes Brazil, China, throughout Eastern Europe, India, and Peru.
While category conditions remain difficult in many D&E countries, government restrictions on social mobility and store operations have eased somewhat since the last quarter.
Finally, in developed markets, organic sales were up 3% driven by strong growth in consumer tissue.
Looking ahead, we're launching Kleenex Proactive Care in the UK and other markets in EMEA.
This lineup includes hand towels, anti-bacterial hand and face wipes, sanitizing gel, and face masks.
Now in terms of market share performance, we continue to make good progress.
We're on track to grow or maintain share in approximately 60% of the 80 category/country combinations that we track.
This is a result of higher investment levels, innovations, and strong in-market executions.
Our capabilities are driving our results and our investments are working hard for us.
Through nine months, I'm very encouraged with our performance, how we're navigating this environment and how our teams are taking care of each other and our customers.
Before closing, I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition of Softex.
This transaction is a strong strategic fit with our focus on accelerating growth in personal care in D&E markets.
Softex expands our presence in a high-growth market where we had limited exposure.
The diaper market in Indonesia is already the sixth largest in the world, and that's projected to nearly triple in size over the next decade.
Our Softex team has built a strong business with deep local market knowledge, excellent brands and market positions and strong profitability.
This transaction improves our underlying growth prospects, and we're looking forward to leveraging our combined strengths in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market.
In conclusion, we're managing through the COVID environment safely and effectively.
We remain optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value.
We're investing in our brands and improving our market positions.
We are raising our full-year outlook and are on track to achieve excellent financial results.
And we continue to operate our business with a balanced and sustainable approach as we execute K-C strategy 2022.
