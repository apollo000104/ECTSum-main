She will give you an update on our operational progress in the fourth quarter.
Next, Echo Yan, our IR director, will review the fourth-quarter and the fiscal-year financials.
After that, I will update you on our business strategy and discuss our business outlook.
I will review the various revenue streams of our tutoring business for the fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2021.
Let me start with small class and other business, which consists of Xueersi Peiyou small class, Firstleap, Mobby, and some other education programs and services.
These accounted for 61% of total net revenue, compared to 68% in the same year-ago period.
Their revenue growth rate was 43% in U.S. dollar terms and 33% in RMB terms.
Xueersi Peiyou small class, which remains our stable core business, represented 63% of total net revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to 69% in the same year-ago period.
The lower revenue contribution from Xueersi Peiyou was mostly due to the faster growth of xueersi.com online courses, which accounted for 32% of total revenue in the quarter, compared to 24% in the same period last year.
Fourth-quarter net revenue from Xueersi Peiyou small class was up by 43% in U.S. dollar terms and 33% in RMB terms.
While our normal price long-term course enrollments increased by 21% year over year.
All in all, the improving overall situation in China supported the continued recovery of our Peiyou business in the course of fiscal-year 2021.
Our key operational metrics of Peiyou such as retention rate, fulfillment rate, and the job upgrade remained very stable throughout the year even in these unprecedented circumstances.
In the fourth quarter, normal price long-term Xueersi Peiyou small-class ASP increased by 22% in U.S. dollar terms and increased by 13% in RMB terms year over year.
The increase was mainly due to the pricing gap refund we offered in February 2020 when we had to migrate Peiyou offline small-class students to online small class.
Xueersi Peiyou small class performed well in the various tiers of cities.
Revenue from the top five cities, which are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Nanjing increased by 44% year over year in U.S. dollar terms and accounted for 55% of Xueersi Peiyou small-class business.
The other cities accounted for 45% of the Xueersi Peiyou small-class business.
Next, I'd like to discuss our Zhikang one-on-one business.
dollar terms and 19% in RMB terms.
Zhikang one-on-one accounted for approximately 6% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2021, compared to 8% in the same year-ago period.
In the fourth quarter, normal price long-term Zhikang one-on-one courses ASP increased by 17% in U.S. dollar terms and 8% in RMB terms year over year.
The increase was mainly due to some slight discounts we offered in February last year when we had to move Zhikang offline students to online after the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the regular increase of tuition fees in several cities during the period.
Now, let me update you on our current capacity expansion strategy.
We continued the expansion drive in the fourth quarter as planned for this fiscal year.
We added eight new cities in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 110 cities.
Of which, 40 were newly added during fiscal-year 2021.
These eight new cities are Ma'anshan, Cangzhou, Weihai, Liaocheng, Rizhao, Yibin, Nanchong, and Zhaoqing.
Similarly, we expanded our learning center network in the fourth quarter based on a healthy and sustainable approach, and by following government guidelines and market demand.
In Q4, we added 108 new learning centers on that basis to a total of 1,098 learning centers.
We opened 119 new Peiyou small-class learning centers and closed nine, and a net of 110 Peiyou small-class learning centers.
We closed five Mobby and Firstleap centers.
And we open four one-on-one centers and closed one one-on-one center, ending at 93 one-on-one centers.
During the quarter, we added 677 Peiyou small-class classrooms.
In all, by the end of February 2021, we've had 1,098 learning centers in 110 cities of which 109 cities in China and one Xueersi Peiyou learning center in the United States.
Among these learning centers, 879 were Peiyou small-class and international education centers, 82 were the merged Firstleap and Mobby small classes, and 137 were Zhikang one-on-one.
Looking into Q1 of the fiscal year 2022, we have conditionally rented some Peiyou small-class learning centers and expect to add a few more and close down some learning centers based on standard operations.
We will closely follow up with government guidelines as always and stay alert for COVID-19 developments.
