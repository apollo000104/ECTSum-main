For the third quarter, we achieved consolidated earnings of $0.76 per share versus $0.72 last year, an increase of $0.04 per share or 5.6%.
Included in the results for the third quarter of 2021 were minimal gains on investments held to fund one of the company's retirement plans, as compared to $0.02 per share of gains included in the third quarter of 2020.
Excluding these gains from both periods, adjusted diluted earnings for the third quarter of 2021 were $0.76 per share, as compared to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $0.06 per share or 8.6%.
Eva will discuss the quarter in more detail.
The third quarter contributed to a strong 2021 year-to-date, where we've achieved 11.7% earnings-per-share growth over last year or 10.7% on an adjusted basis.
Regarding the pending general rate case covering rates for the years 2022 through 2024 at our water utility subsidiary Golden State Water Company, we're pleased to report that we have reached a settlement in principle with the public advocates office of the California Public Utilities Commission or CPUC for short, and nearly all of the items in the case.
I'll touch on this a little more after Eva's update.
On the electric side of the business, we were pleased that in September the CPUC approved Bear Valley Electric Services most recent wildfire mitigation plan, while also in September, the Office of Energy, Infrastructure Safety under the California Natural Resources Agency approved Bear Valley Electric Services latest Safety Certification filing.
The company remains in a strong position, we have successfully navigated the pandemic by continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers, while prioritizing the health and safety of our workforce and compliance with existing government guidelines.
We continue to invest in needed infrastructure that results in high water quality, reliable delivery, systems safety and a commitment to preserving the precious resources that are in our care.
Let me start with our third quarter financial results on Slide eight.
This slide presents our reported result before adjustments.
Consolidated earnings for the third quarter of 2021 were $0.76 per share, as compared to $0.72 per share in 2020.
As Bob mentioned, excluding the gains on investments held to fund, one of our retirement plans from both periods.
Adjusted diluted earnings for the third quarter were $0.76 per share, as compared to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share for the third quarter of 2020.
This represents an increase of $0.06 per share or 8.6%, compared to the adjusted earnings last year.
Our Water segment's reported earnings were $0.62 per share, as compared to $0.57 per share last year.
Excluding the gains on investments, including both quarters adjusted earning at Water segment were $0.62 per share for the third quarter, as compared to adjusted earning of $0.55 per share for the third quarter of last year.
This adjusted increase of $0.07 per share was largely due to higher water operating revenue, less supply costs as a result of new rates for 2021 authorized by the public -- by the California Public Utilities Commission.
Our Electric segment's earnings were $0.04 per share for both periods, an increase in electric operating revenues, less electric supply costs was largely offset by higher operating expenses.
Earnings from our contracted services segment increased $0.01 per share for the quarter, due to a decrease in operating expenses.
Diluted earnings from AWR parent decreased $0.02 per share due to changes in state unitary taxes, as compared to the same period in 2020.
Our consolidated revenue for the quarter increased by $3.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2020, while the revenues increased $4.1 million, due to the third-year step increases for 2021 as a result of passing earnings test.
The increase in electric revenues was largely due to CPUC approved rate increases for 2021.
Contracted services revenues decreased to $1.3 million largely due to lower construction activity, partially offset by increases in management fees, due to the successful resolution of various economic price adjustments.
Turning to Slide 10.
Our water and electric supply costs were $33.3 million for the quarter, an increase of $1 million from last year.
Any changes in supply costs for both the water and electric segments, as compared to the adopted supply costs are tracked in balancing account.
Looking at total operating expenses other than supply costs.
Consolidated expenses decreased $800,000, as compared to the third quarter of last year.
This was primarily due to a decrease in construction costs at our contracted services segment.
Interest expense, net of interest income and other increased by $600,000, due to lower gains generated on investments held for retirement plan during the quarter as previously discussed.
The lower investment gains were partially offset by decrease in interest expense, largely due to the early redemption of private placement notes with a high coupon rates in May of this year.
Slide 11, shows the earnings per share bridge, comparing the third quarter of 2021 with last year's third quarter.
This slide reflects our year-to-date earnings per share by segment as reported, fully diluted earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were $2, as compared to $1.79 for the same period in 2020, included in these results were gains on investments, held to fund a retirement plan, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share and $0.02 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 respectively.
Excluding these gains from both periods.
Adjusted year-to-date earnings for 2021 were $1.96 per share, as compared to adjusted year-to-date earnings of $1.77 per share for 2020.
This results in a 10.7% increase in adjusted EPS.
Turning to liquidity, net cash provided by operating activities were -- was $81.9 million for the first nine months of 2021, as compared to $87.8 million in 2020.
The decrease was partially due to different timing of income tax instalment payments between the two periods.
In addition, there was a decrease in billed surcharges to recover under collections recorded in Golden State Water's, while the revenue adjustment mechanism and the modified cost balancing account.
The decrease in operating cash flow was also due to the timing of building off and cash receipts for construction work at military bases.
This was partially offset by an improvement in cash from accounts receivable related to utility customers, due to -- due in part to improved economic conditions, as compared to the first nine months of 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our regulated utility invested $105.4 million in company-funded capital projects during the nine months -- first nine months this year, and we estimate our full-year 2021 company-funded capital expenditure to be $130 million to $140 million.
At this time, we do not expect American States Water to issue additional equity for at least next three years to fund its current businesses.
I will now provide updates on the California drought and our recent regulatory activity.
Currently, the majority of California is considered to be an extreme drought.
The Governor of California has now proclaimed a state of emergency for all 58 counties within the state and signed an executive order asking all Californians to voluntarily reduce water usage by 15%, as compared to 2020.
CPUC has called on all California investor-owned water utilities to implement voluntary conservation measures to meet this goal.
In response Golden State Water has increased its communication with customers regarding the need for conservation, implemented voluntary conservation efforts in nearly all of its rate making areas and mandatory water reduction in a few small customer service areas on the coast.
We have also established a CPUC approved Water Conservation Memorandum Account to track incremental drought-related costs for future recovery.
As we discussed in our prior calls Golden State Water filed a general rate case application for all its water regions and the general office in July 2020.
This general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2022 through 2024.
Among other things, Golden State Water requested capital budgets of approximately $450.6 million for the three-year rate cycle and another $11.4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through advice letters, when those projects are completed.
Golden State Water and the public advocates office of the CPUC have reached the settlement agreement in principle on the majority of the items in this general rate case application.
The unsettled matters are Golden State Water's request for: one, a medical cost balancing account; two, general liability insurance cost balancing account; and three, the consolidation of two of Golden State Water's customer service areas.
The date to file a joint motion for approval of settlement agreement to the CPUC has been proposed for November 23rd, 2021.
As a result of this proposed timing a final decision in the case from the CPUC is now expected in 2022.
When a final decision is issued in 2022, the new rates adopted in the final decision will be effective retroactive to January 1st, 2022.
Since we are still in the process of drafting the settlement agreement with the public advocates office, we cannot share any further details at this time.
As a reminder, the administrative law judge assigned to this rate case has previously clarified that Golden State Water can continue using the water revenue adjustment mechanism or RAM.
And the modified cost balancing account, also known as the MCBA until our next general rate case application covering the years 2025 through 2027.
Regarding our cost of capital application, which was filed in May of this year, we requested capital structure of 57% equity and 43% debt, which is our currently adopted capital structure.
A return on equity of 10.5% and a return on rate base of 8.18%.
There was a pre-hearing conference held in September, but the scoping memo with an official schedule has not been published.
Final decision is expected in the first half of 2022 with an effective date retroactive to January 1st, 2022.
As part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Golden State Water and Bear Valley Electric Service have suspended service disconnections for non-payment pursuant to CPUC orders.
On July 15th of this year, the CPUC issued a final decision on the second phase of the water utility low income affordability rulemaking, which among other things, extended the existing moratorium on water service disconnections, due to non-payment until the earlier of February 1st 2022 or pursuant to further CPUCs guidance on the matter.
On June 24th of this year, the CPUC issued a final decision to extend the moratorium on electric disconnections until September 30th of this year.
None of the terms of CPUC adopted payment plans, actual electric service disconnections for non-payment will not occur until approximately December 1st of this year.
For Golden State Water and Bear Valley Electric Service, we are tracking incremental costs, including bad debt expense in excess of what is included in their respective revenue requirements, incurred as a result of the pandemic and CPUC approved COVID-19-related memorandum accounts, which are to be filed with the CPUC for future recovery.
CPUC requires that amounts tracked in the company's COVID-19 memorandum accounts for unpaid customer bills be offset by any federal and state relief for water utility bill debt and customer payments through payment plan arrangements prior to receiving recovery from customers.
On July 12th of this year, the Governor of California approved almost $1 billion in relief funding for overdue Water Customer Bills and almost $1 billion in relief funding for overdue Electric Customer Bills.
Golden State Water and Bear Valley Electric Service intend to seek recovery of overdue amounts from all available funding sources.
Funds for both water and electric utility relief are expected to be distributed to utilities during the fourth quarter of 2021, for the first quarter of 2000 -- for the first quarter of 2022.
Turning our attention to Slide 18, this slide presents the growth in Golden State Water's rate base as authorized by the CPUC for 2018 through 2021.
The adopted weighted average water rate base has grown from $752.2 million in 2018 to $980.4 million in 2021, a compound annual growth rate of 9.2%.
The rate base amounts for 2021 do not include any rate recovery for advice letter projects.
Let's move on to ASUS on Slide 19.
ASUSs earnings contribution increased by $0.01 per share to $0.11 during the third quarter of 2021, as compared to the same quarter last year, largely due to a decrease in overall operating expenses.
For the year-to-date September 30th, 2021 ASUSs earnings contribution is $0.05 per share higher than last year, primarily due to an overall increase in construction activity and management fee revenue, as well as a decrease in overall operating expenses, including lower, legal and other outside services costs, labor cost and maintenance expense.
The increase in construction activity was largely due to timing differences of when work was performed, as compared to the first nine months of 2020.
We reaffirm our projection that ASUS will contribute $0.45 to $0.09 per share for 2021.
We continue to work closely with the US government for contract modifications relating to potential capital upgrade work for improvement of the water and wastewater infrastructure at the military bases, we serve.
However, the continuing volatility of prices for materials and slower than anticipated recovery in the supply of materials from the COVID-19 pandemic could cause delays in construction activity for existing projects.
And are likely to result in deferrals of government procurement to award new capital upgrade projects.
Given the uncertainties we project ASUS to contribute the same range of earnings $0.45 to $0.49 per share for 2022.
US government is expected to release additional bases for bidding over the next several years.
We are actively involved in various stages of the proposal process at a number of bases currently considering privatization [Technical Issues] continue to have a good relationship with the US government, as well as a strong history and expertise in managing water and Wastewater Systems on military bases.
And we are -- we believe we are well positioned to compete for these new contracts.
I would like to turn our attention to dividends, which is a compelling part of the company's investment story.
Last week, the Board of Directors approved a fourth quarter dividend of $0.365 per common share.
If you recall last quarter, the Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in the annual dividend from $1.34 per share to $1.46 per share.
Currently, our dividend policy is to provide a compound annual growth rate of more than 7% over the long-term.
Compound annual dividend growth rate for the quarterly dividend is 9% over the last five years and nearly 10% over the last 10-years.
Our log and consistent history of dividend payments dates back to 1931.
In addition to an unbroken 67-year history of annual calendar year dividend increases.
