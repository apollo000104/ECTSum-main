I'm joined today by Scott Buckhout, CIRCOR's president and CEO; and Abhi Khandelwal, the company's chief financial officer.
These expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by today's remarks.
You can find a full discussion of these factors in CIRCOR's Form 10-K, 10-Qs and other SEC filings also located on our website.
CIRCOR delivered another strong quarter and executed well despite a challenging global supply chain environment.
We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical products with year-to-date orders in backlog up 11% and 15%, respectively.
Notably, Industrial organic orders growth was 28% in the quarter and our Industrial backlog is up 30% year-to-date, well above pre-pandemic levels.
While aerospace and defense orders were down in the quarter due to timing, we're well positioned on growing commercial and defense programs and continue to launch new products for our customers.
Revenue in the quarter was up 2% organically with operating margin up 80 basis points year over year and 240 basis points sequentially.
EPS was up 39% versus last year.
It's important to note that revenue and earnings for the quarter were adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions that intensified through the last month of the quarter.
More specifically, we saw approximately $10 million of revenue pushed out of Q3 due to supplier input delays, logistics constraints and ongoing labor availability challenges.
This reduced our organic growth by roughly 5 points in the quarter.
Our teams are working to mitigate the impact of supply chain issues by qualifying alternate suppliers, reengineering product with higher-grade materials and expediting shipping in order to continue delivering to our customers as committed.
Looking forward, we expect these challenges to continue through the fourth quarter, resulting in a $15 million impact on revenue.
For the year, we expect approximately $25 million of revenue to push out of 2021.
This is reflected in our revised full year guidance, which Abhi will discuss later.
Our strategic priorities on people, growth acceleration, margin expansion and free cash flow continue to be our guiding principles.
I'll talk more about select accomplishments from Q3 later in the call.
Let's start with the financial highlights on Slide 3.
Organic orders of $194 million in the quarter were up 15% versus prior year.
We saw a strong year-over-year increase of 28% in industrial with growth in all regions.
Orders were down 10% in aerospace and defense due to the timing of large defense orders.
Organic revenue was $191 million, up 1% versus prior year.
Revenue came in approximately $10 million lower than expected as a result of the supply chain challenges that Scott mentioned upfront.
Adjusted operating income was $19 million or 10.1%, up 80 basis points from prior year and up 240 basis points from the previous quarter.
Finally, we delivered $0.50 of adjusted earnings per share, up 39% versus prior year and generated free cash flow of $7 million.
Moving to Slide 4.
Industrial organic orders were up 28% versus last year and down 9% sequentially.
Order growth was apparent across all regions, with particular strength in North America and EMEA.
Aftermarket orders were up 42% and our downstream aftermarket backlog is the highest it has been since 2017.
Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter and year-to-date is 1.1%, an indication of continued end market demand.
Industrial organic revenue was up 3% versus last year and up 1% sequentially.
By region, we saw year-over-year strength in EMEA, China and India, partially offset by lower revenue in North America.
Despite the strong backlog from the first half, supply chain and logistic constraints became a bigger challenge than expected late in the quarter.
This adversely impacted revenue by $6 million or 5 points of organic growth.
Adjusted operating margin was 8.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year and up 70 basis points versus Q2.
Improvements were driven by productivity and continued value-based pricing up 2%, partially offset by higher inflation.
We expect further margin expansion in Q4.
Turning to Slide 5.
aerospace and defense orders were $54 million down 10% versus last year and flat sequentially.
Orders were lower versus prior year due to a large non-repeat defense order for the Dreadnought submarine in 2020.
The commercial aerospace recovery continues led by narrow-body programs.
We've seen sequential growth for the past three consecutive quarters.
Revenue was $61 million, down 2% year over year and up 2% from prior quarter.
Slightly lower revenue was primarily driven by lower defense OEM shipments, partially offset by recovery in commercial aerospace, up 10% and an improvement in defense aftermarket revenue, up 7%.
Similar to Industrial, aerospace and defense was also impacted by the global supply chain and logistic constraints, which negatively impacted the quarter by $4 million or six points of growth.
Finally, operating margin was 24.2% in the quarter, up 50 basis points year over year and up 430 basis points from Q2.
We were still able to expand margin in a challenging global environment through pricing actions, productivity and favorable defense program mix.
We expect margin in Q4 to be roughly in line with prior year.
Turning to Slide 6.
Free cash flow in the quarter was $7 million, an improvement versus prior year but lower than expected.
More specifically, we had planned for higher milestone collections on long-term projects that moved out of the quarter.
We will collect this cash in future quarters as we complete these projects.
We reduced our total debt by $23 million versus prior year and ended Q3 with $445 million of net debt.
Due to the lower earnings and cash outlook for the year, we now expect to improve our leverage by approximately 0.3 turns by the end of the year.
We will continue to use all free cash flow generated to delever.
Starting with fourth quarter guidance.
We expect revenue to be up 1% to 3% organically, which includes $15 million of delayed revenue out of the quarter due to continued global supply chain, logistics and labor challenges.
For Industrial, we expect orders in Q4 to be up more than 10% and revenue is expected to be up 3% to 6% with growth across most end markets.
In A&D, fourth quarter orders are expected to be up greater than 50% driven by large OEM defense programs.
Revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat to down 5%, with double-digit growth in commercial aerospace and defense aftermarket, offset by lower deliveries on defense programs.
We're expecting adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 in the fourth quarter with incremental and decremental margins of 30% to 35%.
Corporate cost is expected to increase by $1 million versus prior year.
Finally, we're planning for free cash flow of $10 million to $15 million in Q4 as we expect supply chain constraints will continue to impact our ability to complete in-process projects and collect milestone billings from customers.
As a result of the supply chain challenges late in Q3 and into Q4, we are revising our full year guidance.
Organic revenue is expected to be flat to down 2%, which reflects $25 million of revenue delayed out of the year.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.74 is lower as a result of this reduction in volume and free cash flow is expected to be $4 million to $9 million.
Now, I'll hand it back to Scott to discuss our market outlook.
Let's get started with our Industrial outlook on Slide 8.
As Abhi mentioned, in the third quarter, we saw continued order strength across all Industrial regions, with year-to-date backlog exceeding pre-COVID levels.
In Q4, we expect another quarter of double-digit orders growth led by North America.
Virtually all end markets are expected to grow with commercial marine and downstream showing the largest year-over-year improvement.
On revenue, we expect modest improvement year over year with growth between 3% and 6%.
Our short-cycle products are expected to be up 6% to 9% overall, primarily driven by aftermarket growth between 8% and 11%.
Our longer-cycle end markets are expected to be roughly in line with last year.
Many of our midstream and downstream customers are prioritizing aftermarket projects in the near term and our OEM project pipeline and backlog remain strong.
In commercial marine, we expect to see growth as shipbuilding activity in Asia continues to recover from historically low levels.
Finally, pricing is expected to net roughly 2% and as pricing actions that were taken in Q2 and Q3 start to roll through our top and bottom line.
Moving to aerospace and defense.
Q3 orders were flat sequentially and down versus prior year, driven by a large non-repeat order in Q3 2020.
We expect a significant increase in Q4 orders.
The increase versus prior quarter and prior year is driven by large defense orders, continuing recovery in commercial aerospace and strong medical growth.
A&D revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be flat to down 5% versus prior year, primarily due to supply chain constraints and the timing of shipments for large defense programs.
Defense revenue is expected to be down 10% to 15% with lower shipments on our OEM programs.
On the other hand, government orders for defense spares and MRO services picked up in the third quarter and we expect aftermarket revenue growth of 10% to 15%.
Commercial aerospace is expected to continue its recovery with 25% to 30% growth following three consecutive quarters of sequential orders growth.
Revenue from commercial air framers will be up 20% to 25% and mostly driven by the increased recovery in narrow-body aircraft production, most notably the A320.
Aftermarket revenue growth is expected to improve as aircraft utilization continues to increase.
Finally, pricing is expected to be a net benefit of 3% for defense and 4% for commercial.
I'd like to provide a third quarter update on our previously shared strategic priorities.
These priorities continue to guide what our team works on every day.
We're investing in growth.
We launched eight new products in Q3 and remain on track to deliver 45 new products by the end of 2021.
I'll share two exciting new products on the next slide.
Next, our teams continue to drive price increases in both Industrial and aerospace and defense to help offset growing inflation.
Many of these price increases are permanent and will help drive top and bottom-line growth going forward.
In Industrial, we increased prices or implemented surcharges on many of our product lines in Q2 and Q3.
This drove the incremental price we're showing in Q3 and Q4.
For A&D, we typically match the length of our customer contracts with our supplier contracts, which has helped us mitigate material inflation.
Additionally, we continue to use value-based pricing where appropriate, especially in the aftermarket.
To drive margin expansion, we're making key investments at two of our biggest industrial sites in the U.S. and Germany.
With new modern equipment and processes implemented, we expect to see an improvement in safety, quality and productivity.
We're making really good progress with our 80/20 initiative.
With this structured approach, we've built a meaningful pipeline of growth and simplification opportunities and have already used 80/20 to implement strategic price increases at our U.S. site.
Even more importantly, when talking to the teams, it's apparent that 80/20 is becoming a part of our culture and how we do business.
Before we move to Q&A, I want to highlight two new products we recently launched.
These products are particularly exciting because they show how CIRCOR is accelerating growth by leveraging our technical expertise into new growing markets where we do not currently play.
For the past several years, our team has been looking for opportunities to penetrate the green energy sector by leveraging our sealing technology and competence in designing and manufacturing products for high-pressure gas storage and transport applications.
The first set of products is for applications in the hydrogen market.
Hydrogen Isolation Valves and Modular Dome Regulators are critical components of the control system on hydrogen gas transportation trailers.
Our balanced isolation valve has very low leak rates at extreme temperatures and pressures and the Modular Dome Regulator developed and manufactured in India allows stable pressure control.
We're the first supplier to meet the latest EU transportation regulation on the balance valve and we're able to secure more than $1 million of initial orders so far in 2021.
The second new product I want to share is a switch module with kinetic sensors for landing gear position detectors on commercial aircraft.
Our switch module inside the aircraft wheel is engineered to detect the landing gear position and turn on the electric motor allowing the aircraft a taxi itself of no engine or towing.
This technology not only allows more efficient and safer ground transportation, but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions by burning less fuel.
Both of these new products showcase how we're accelerating growth through new product development and expanding our portfolio into new markets.
