Let's begin with the summary of the results on Page 3.
We expect Q2 to be challenging and in preparation, we reinforced our cost program earlier in Q1, so we were in some sense prepared for the battle.
We ended the quarter with a comprehensive set of actions to manage through the turbulent times and focused on what we can control, our operations, costs and importantly safety of our employees.
From an operational point of view, we are not out of the woods yet, but a significant majority of our facilities are up and running moving into Q3 which is positive to operating leverage as compared to this quarter.
Top line trends are very much in line with our expectations entering the quarter.
Revenue declined 16% organically and bookings declined 21%.
Trends have improved in the quarter and we saw a material sequential improvement in June.
We still carry a strong backlog across all segments and that increases our confidence for the second half.
Margin performance for the quarter was acceptable considering the state of business activity in April and May.
After profitability gains in Q1 on lower revenue, we targeted 25% to 30% decremental margin for the full year.
That puts us on track to exceed our initial full-year target.
In addition to the tight cost controls and variable costs, we took further structural cost actions in the quarter as part of our business realignment activities, which will benefit us in the second half.
Along with our cost actions, our proactive working capital management resulted in cash flow improvement in both absolute and conversion terms.
We generated $78 million more in free cash flow than the comparable quarter last year.
As a result of our first half performance and our solid order backlog, we are reinstating our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.00 to $5.25 per share.
To be clear, even with a strong backlog and positive recent trends, we still see demand uncertainty in our markets and are not back to business as usual, but our teams have proven their ability to manage costs and operations and we are prepared to operate and achieve results in a wide variety of scenarios that may be in store for the second half.
Let's take a look at the segment performance on Slide 4.
Engineered Products at a tough quarter particularly in the shortest cycle on capex-levered businesses like vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation and industrial winches.
Waste hauling and aerospace & defense were more resilient shipping against their strong backlogs.
Lower volumes led to margin decline versus a very strong margin that this segment posted in the comparable quarter last year, and we have taken structural cost actions in this segment, which will support its margin in the second half along with reconvering volumes.
Fueling Solutions saw continued strong activity in North America driven by demand of EMV compliance solutions.
Whereas, Europe and Asia declined due to COVID related production and supply chain interruptions as well as budget cuts and deferrals in response to the decline in oil prices.
Increased margin performance was commendable with 80 basis point increase on a better mix pricing and ongoing productivity actions.
The sales decline in Imaging & Identification was driven predominantly a steep decline in our digital textile printing business which we expected in the significant dislocation in global apparel and fashion markets due to the pandemic.
Marking & coding -- marking & coding showed continued resilience on strong demand for consumables and fast-moving consumer goods solutions.
This is our highest gross margin segment.
So decremental margins are challenging and require heavy lifting on cost containment, where marking & coding business did a good job, achieving a flat margin year-over-year and we have taken proactive actions to manage the cost base in the digital printing business.
As a result of these actions and a pickup in textiles consumable volumes, we expect performance to improve in the second half.
Pumps & Process Solutions demonstrated the resilience we expected.
It's top line decline the least among our segments despite a challenging comparable from last year.
Strong growth -- strong growth continued in biopharma and medical applications with colder products posting record growth in the quarter.
This was offset by a moderate decline in industrial applications and material slowing and energy markets.
Our Plastics Processing business revenue declined in the quarter as a result of shipment timing, we expect to -- for it to do well in the second half of a strong backlog.
As you can see this segment continued to deliver a solid margin performance posting improving margin on declining revenue for the second quarter in a row, we expect this segment to deliver flat or improved absolute profit for the full year.
Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined as food retailers continued to delay construction remodels due to peak utilization and the commercial food service market remains severely impacted by restaurant and school closures in the United States.
Our heat exchanger business showed resilience particularly in non-HVAC applications.
On the margin side, negative absorption on lower volumes drove the margin decline.
In Q2, we took structural cost actions in this segment, which paired with ongoing productivity and automation initiatives yield in a materially improved margin performance in the month of June.
We expect these benefits to continue accruing in the second half and expect this segment to deliver year-over-year growth in absolute earnings and margin in the second half of this year.
I'll pass it to Brad here.
Let's go to Slide 5.
On the top is the revenue bridge.
FX continued to be a meaningful headwind in Q2, reducing top line by 1% or $24 million.
We expect FX to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year.
Acquisitions were effectively offset by dispositions in the quarter.
The revenue breakdown by geography reflects relatively more resilient trends in North America and Asia versus the more significant impacts across Europe and several emerging economies like India, Brazil and Mexico.
The US, our largest market declined 10% organically, with four segments posting organic declines, partially offset by growth in retail fueling.
All of Asia declined 14%.
China representing approximately half of our business in Asia, showed early signs of stabilization posting an 11% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, an improvement compared to a 36% decline in Q1.
Imaging & Identification and Engineered Products were up in China while Fueling Solutions declined due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and also slower demand from the local national oil companies.
Europe was down 19% on organic declines in all five segments.
Moving to the bottom of the page.
Bookings were down 21% organically on declines across all five segments, but there are reasons for cautious optimism as we enter the second half.
First, as presented in the box on the bottom, June bookings saw a significant improvement from the May trough, with all five segments posting double-digit month-over-month sequential growth.
Second, our backlog is up 8% compared to this time last year, driven by our longer cycle businesses and the previously mentioned intra-quarter improvement in our shorter cycle businesses.
We believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year.
Let's move to the bridges on Slide 6.
I'll refrain from going into too much detail on the chart, but the adverse top line trend drove EBIT declines, although our cost containment and productivity initiatives help offset overall margins to hold up at an acceptable decremental.
In the quarter, we delivered on the $50 million annual cost reduction program, which focuses on IT footprint and back office efficiency, and took additional restructuring charges that add to the expected benefits.
We also executed well in the quarter on additional cost takeout to offset the under-absorbed -- under-absorption of fixed cost previously estimated at $35 million to $40 million.
Some of these recent initiatives will continue supporting margins in the second half and into 2021.
Going to the bottom chart.
Adjusted earnings declined mainly due to lower segment earnings, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes on lower earnings.
The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately 21.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the first quarter.
Discrete tax benefits in the quarter were approximately $2 million, slightly lower than the prior year's second quarter.
Rightsizing and other costs were $17 million in the quarter or $13 million after-tax relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into 2020.
Now moving to Slide 7.
We are pleased with the cash generation in the first half of the year, with year-to-date free cash flow of $269 million, a $126 million or 90% increase over last year.
Our teams have done a good job managing capital more effectively in this uncertain environment.
We have seen strong collections on accounts receivables.
We continue to operate with inventories of supportive of our backlog in order trends.
Q2 also benefited from an approximately $40 million deferral of US tax payments into the second half of the year.
Capital expenditures were $79 million for the first six months of the year, a $12 million decline versus the comparable period last year.
Most of our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects were completed in the second quarter.
So we expect to see continued year-over-year capital expenditure declines in the second half.
Lastly now on Slide 8.
Dover's financial position remains strong.
We have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage of 2.2 times EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating with a safety -- with a margin of safety.
Second, we are operating with approximately $1.6 billion of current liquidity, which consists of $650 million of cash and $1 billion of unused revolver capacity.
When commercial paper markets were fractured at the outset of the pandemic in March, we drew $500 million on our revolver out of an abundance of caution.
Markets have since stabilized and we reestablished our commercial paper program and fully repaid the revolver.
In Q2, we also secured a new incremental $450 million revolver facility to further bolster our liquidity position.
As of June, we have no drawn funds on either revolver.
Our prudent capital structure, access to liquidity and strong cash flow have allowed us to largely maintain our capital allocation posture.
We can -- we have deployed nearly a $250 million on accretive acquisitions so far this year and we continue to pursue attractive acquisitions.
Finally, we are lifting our recent suspension on share repurchase and we will opportunistically buyback stock should the market conditions dictate.
I'm on Page 9, which is an updated view of the demand outlook by business we introduced last quarter.
Here we are trying to provide you with directional estimates of how we expect segments to perform in the second half relative to the second quarter in lieu of full year revenue guidance.
I'll caveat that all of this is based on current reads of the markets and is subject to change as the situation remains fluid.
First in Engineered Products, shorter cycle businesses such as vehicle service and industrial automation have shown improvement late in the quarter and the trends are improving globally.
Additionally aerospace and defense continues operating from a large backlog of defense program orders.
Waste handling may see some headwinds driven by tightening of industry capex and municipal finances after several years of strong growth performance.
Bookings have slowed in late in Q2 as customers pause their capital spending to manage liquidity.
We are watching the dynamics closely, but we have started addressing the cost base in this business proactively.
Fueling Solutions is a tale of two cities, North America, approximately half the business remain resilient both on EMV conversion and also willingness of non-integrated retailers to continue investing in their asset base.
In Europe and Asia, integrated oil companies represent a larger share of the network and capital budget cuts resulting from oil price declines are having a more negative impact on investment in the retail network, plus recall we are facing a $50 million revenue headwind in China this year from the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate, despite some of the top line headwinds with robust margin accretion to date, we expect segment to hold its comparable full-year profit line despite a decreasing top line.
Imaging & Identification outlook is improving.
Our service and maintenance interventions resumed in market and coding as travel restrictions were lifted, and we are seeing a resulting pickup demand for printers.
Our integration activities with Systech acquisition are proceeding as planned.
We started seeing some green shoots on the digital textile printing side, but we are forecasting a difficult year as global textiles will take time to recover.
In Pumps & Process Solutions is expected to show improved trajectory from here.
First, our plastics and polymer businesses will ship against it's significant backlog in the second half.
Biopharma and medical is expected to continue its impressive growth.
Industrial pumps, a shorter cycle business is expected to start gradually recovering.
A material portion of demand in our pumps and precision components business is levered to maintenance and repair and aftermarket.
The oil and gas mid and downstream markets served primarily by precision components business continues to slow as a result of deferral of capex and refurbishment spending in refining and pipelined operators.
In Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we believe the worst is behind us for this segment.
Bookings were relatively resilient for this segment and we have improved in June, resulting in a robust backlog that we are prepared to execute against.
We also saw growth is restarting the construction and remodel projects resulting in us being fully booked for refrigeration cases into Q4.
Additionally Belvac is scheduled to begin shipments against it's significant backlog, which will be accretive to segment margins.
Recovery in volumes along with cost actions we've undertaken should result in positive margin and profit trend through the remainder of the year resulting in the segment posting a second half comparable profit increase.
Let's go to Slide 10.
As a result of the fluidity of the COVID situation, we are cautious about guiding top line trajectory at this time, but everything points to sequential improvement from here across most markets.
The proactive cost management stance we took in Q1 and continued in Q2 has positioned us from a margin performance standpoint, and today we are improving our target for annual decrementals margin to 20% to 25%.
We continue work in the pipeline of restructuring actions, including those targeting benefits in 2021, and we are positioned well to deliver on our margin objectives.
We remain confident in the cash flow capacity of this portfolio and reiterating a conversion target above 100% of adjusted net earnings and a cash flow margin target of 10% to 12% compared to 8% to 12% target we had last year.
I'll conclude with the following.
We have reinitiated earnings per share guidance as a result of our confidence in our ability to manage costs in an uncertain demand environment.
We have a good team, and they understand the playbook.
Having said that, make no mistake, we are on the front foot from here on driving revenue growth, both organically and inorganically.
We have strong operating companies and a strong balance sheet with which to support them.
This is not the time to hunker down and wait for the storm to pass, so we are equally focused on market share gains, new product development initiatives as we are on our main pillars of synergy extraction from our portfolio, all of which we continue to fund, despite the market challenges.
Inorganically we have available capital to deploy and I fully expect to be active in the second half.
And with that let's go to Q&A.
