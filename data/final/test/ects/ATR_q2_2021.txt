I would now like to turn the conference call over to Stephan.
I hope that you are doing well.
I would like to discuss a few highlights as mentioned on Slide three.
In summary, sales increased in each of our reporting segments with currency-related tailwinds adding to the core growth.
The right breadth of our portfolio of solutions and services continues to be a key strength of Aptar as we generated growth in each segment and double-digit growth overall for the company.
Bob will speak in more detail on sales by market when he gives his update.
Similar to the first quarter, growth of our Pharma segment was driven by strong demand for elastomeric components for injectable drugs and exit Material Solutions, which offset declines in sales to the prescription and consumer healthcare markets, which continue to be impacted by customers drawing down inventory levels in key categories.
Our Beauty + Home segment reported solid growth in the beauty and home care markets, the former being mostly on easier comparison to the depressed second quarter of 2020 although with some initial signs of recovery.
Sales to the personal care market were slightly below the prior year's strong performance as hand sanitizer demand is normalizing.
Approximately 75% of the growth came from increased volumes.
In our Food + Beverage segment, top line growth was strong across each market segment with about 60% of the growth coming from price adjustments related to the passing through of higher resin costs.
It continues to be a very challenging input cost environment, and we are in the process of passing through higher input costs to our customers.
Our overall margin was also affected by the mix of sales within our Pharma segment, favoring some of our lower-margin businesses in pharma.
We also remain active on the M&A front making several strategic investments.
During the quarter, we announced that we were in the process to acquire the outstanding shares of Voluntis, a pioneer in digital therapeutics.
This is a significant step in building our foundation in the fast-growing digital healthcare space.
If we have learned anything from the pandemic, it is that advancements in healthcare are rapidly accelerating.
And things like remote patient engagement and patient monitoring, whether for clinical trials or real-world treatment, will be a big part of each of our futures.
Just this week, we announced another pharma transaction.
We have entered into an agreement to acquire 80% of Weihai Hengyu Medical Products, a leading manufacturer of elastomer components for injection devices in China.
This investment gives us immediate local and regional supply capabilities in the critical and growing injectable space.
Also, subsequent to the quarter, we announced the collaboration with a Chinese skin care company called YAP to bring new skin care solutions to the market.
We look forward to leveraging YAP's expansive market insight database focused on specific consumer skin care needs and skin care profiles, and we will use YAP's in-depth experience and customized turnkey solutions as well as online product distribution and promotion.
On the sustainability front, we have been active in forming strategic partnerships to further our progress toward a more circular economy where plastic can be recycled and reused.
To that end, we have formed a partnership and are serving as a strategic advisor to a company called Repo to offer a reusable water bottle that uses technology to help people stay high graded while helping to collect castaway plastic bottles.
Now on Slide four, I would like to speak to a few environment, social and governance, or ESG updates.
As previously announced, 3BL Media evaluated the 1,000 largest public U.S. companies on ESG performance, and Aptar is honored to be named among the top 50 companies who are leading in corporate citizenship.
We also announced the launch of our 2020 Sustainability Report, which highlights again our extensive sustainability initiatives that have been implemented across our global operations, and we invite you to read the report on our website.
Our first comprehensive sustainability report was for the year 2014.
So our experience in engagement is built on deep expertise and a long track record.
Canvas is a highly accomplished business leader with over 30 years of experience developing and marketing products for the healthcare, cosmetics, food and beverage industries.
And she has held leadership positions with Amway, Loreal, Coca-Cola and Procter and Gamble, among others.
Our directors provide valuable guidance and keen oversight based on their first-hand operating experience in the end market and geographic regions in which we operate as well as functional expertise and multicultural insights.
Candace is a valuable addition to Aptar's Board with deep contemporary knowledge of our markets, including having spent a significant time in China.
Turning now to Slide five, in new product and technology launches.
I would like to briefly comment on several product introductions that will highlight the breadth of our offerings.
In pharma, our elastomer softwares used with injection systems continue to play an important role in the COVID-19 vaccine distributions worldwide, including a vaccine approved in Latin America.
We're also supplying stockers for several animal vaccines in Mexico.
In the prescription drug market, the central nervous system pipeline is active, and we have several customers making progress with nasal delivery of a variety of medicines in the area of opioid overdose antidote, epinephrine medicines to treat suicidal tendencies.
In Consumer Healthcare, our pressure-free ophthalmic squeeze dispenser is the delivery device for a new over-the-counter iLubricant by Bausch and Lomb Biotrue brand in the U.S. In Beauty + Home, we recently announced a strategic sustainable dispensing system, our first fully recyclable non-material dispenser pump for the beauty and personal care products called Future.
Because the Future pump is made only from polyethylene, it also aligns with the most common materials used to make the bottles, polyethylene and polyester, or PET.
Therefore, the complete packaging, including pump and bottle, are more easily recycled.
We also supplied our prestige fragrance pump for a new Tom Ford fragrance and our dispensing closure for Dollar Shave Club's New shampoo and conditioner line, most recently launched in the U.S. Also in the U.S., our airless pump is the dispensing solution for Coty's Cover Girl + Olay brand color cosmetics product called Eye Rehab.
Finally, in the home care market, our closure with SimpliSqueeze valve is featured on the NUK dish care product in Europe.
In Food + Beverage, we received critical guidance recognition from the Association of Plastic Recyclers for our SimpliCycle recyclable valve technology.
Or SimpliCycle valve is made from a low-density materials that allows the valve to float so it is easily separated from the polyester stream and then ultimately recycled twisted polypropylene or polyethylene olefin stream.
In the food market, our custom closures are featured on a limited additional line of mash-up sauces, including hot sales coupled with ranch and tartar sauce combined with ketchup by KraftHeinz in Canada.
Nestle has also launched a new range of condiments with flavors from the Middle East called Mezeast, which feature our food closures.
Turning to the beverage market.
Our closure with SimpliSqueeze valve is the dispensing solution for a new concentrate product in Germany called Creme de la Cream Concentrates by ALDI.
Starting with Slide six.
As Stephan mentioned, we had a strong top line performance in the quarter, and I will walk through some of the market growth in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide seven.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.91 per share on a comparable basis with the prior year and when neutralizing currency effects.
Aptar's adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $148 million compared to the prior year, and this included the negative impact of the shift in business across our markets as well as a net negative inflation impact of approximately $9 million.
Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin would have been approximately 180 basis points higher without the net negative inflation effect and the margin compression impact from passing on the higher costs.
Slide eight and nine cover our year-to-date performance and show the 5% core sales growth and our adjusted earnings per share which were $2.01, up 10% compared to the $1.83 a year ago, including comparable exchange rates.
Briefly summarizing our segment results, our Pharma business performance was mixed across the different divisions with total segment core sales growth of 2%.
Pharma had an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 33%, which was reflective of the mix of business across the different markets compared to the previous year.
Additionally, Pharma's margin was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to net negative inflation costs in the quarter of approximately $2 million.
Looking at sales growth by market compared to the prior year.
Core sales to the prescription market decreased 7%, and core sales to the consumer healthcare market decreased 1% as certain pharma customers in these markets continue to draw down inventory levels as treatment for allergic rhinitis and cough and cold are impacted by low levels of patient consumption and fewer overall noncritical doctor appointments.
It was another strong quarter for components used for injectable medicines and our active material solutions.
Core sales to the injectables market increased 14%, and half of the growth was related to vaccine administration, of which the majority was for COVID-19 vaccines.
Core sales of our active material science solutions increased 20%, primarily due to increased sales of our protective packaging solutions for probiotic products and COVID-19 diagnostic test solutions.
Turning to our Beauty + Home segment.
core sales increased 13% over the prior year second quarter, which is the most difficult period during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Approximately 75% of the growth came from increased volumes.
This segment's adjusted EBITDA margin was 11% in the quarter and was negatively impacted by the timing of passing through increased resin and other raw material costs as well as other inflationary costs, which had negatively affected adjusted EBITDA by roughly $5 million.
Had we not had this net negative inflation impact and we did not have the margin compression effect of passing through the higher costs, EBITDA margins would have been approximately 180 basis points higher.
Looking at sales growth by market on a core basis.
Core sales to the beauty market increased 28% due to higher consumer demand for fragrances and facial skin care products.
Core sales to the personal care market decreased 1% as higher sales to the hair care and sun care markets were offset by declines in personal cleansing as hand sanitizer demand normalizes.
Core sales to the home care market increased 26% on strong demand for a variety of applications and increased custom tooling sales.
Turning to our Food + Beverage segment, which had another solid performance, core sales increased 23%.
Approximately 60% of the core sales increase is due to passing through higher resin and other input costs.
The segment had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16% and was negatively impacted by net inflationary cost increases of approximately $2 million.
Had we not had this net negative inflation impact and we did not have the margin compression effect of passing through higher costs, EBITDA margins would have been approximately 360 basis points higher.
Looking at each market, core sales to the food market increased 21% as volume rose on increased demand for specialty food dispensing closures as consumers continue to cook at home.
Core sales to the beverage market increased 26% as we realized some recovery over a very low prior year second quarter.
Moving now to Slide 10, which summarizes our outlook for the third quarter.
I'd like to take a minute to remind everyone that in the prior year third quarter, we had a progresssignificant amount of cost and tooling sales that caused an atypical jump in our sales last year in our Active Material Solutions Group, where we were up over 50% in year-over-year top line growth.
As Stephan mentioned, while we expect the second half to continue to show signs of recovery, our expectation is now for a stronger recovery toward the end of the year.
There's still a lot of uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery, and many of our customers remain cautious.
We don't yet see a significant change in the prescription drug market in the third quarter but are anticipating an improvement in the fourth.
We expect our third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding any restructuring expenses, acquisition costs and changes in the fair value of equity investments, to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.98 per share.
The estimated tax rate range for the third quarter is 28% to 30%.
While we don't give guidance beyond the coming quarter earnings per share range, we have mentioned our optimism around the fourth quarter, and that would imply that our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share range should be above the third quarter, nearer to the current published consensus of equity research analysts.
In closing, we continue to have a strong balance sheet with a leverage ratio of approximately 1.5.
On a gross basis, debt to capital was approximately 36%.
While on a net basis, it was approximately 29%.
In addition, we continue to invest in innovative growth projects, and we are confirming our forecasted range of capital expenditures for the year at a range of $300 million to $330 million.
At this time, Stephan will provide a few closing comments before we move to Q&A.
In closing, on Slide 11, I'm very proud of our people and the work we have accomplished through the first half of the year amid these unprecedented times.
As certain economies begin to reopen, we expect the recovery in our beauty, beverage and prescription pharma business to gradually progress.
However, this recovery is likely to occur at a measured pace given the uncertainties around the COVID-19 variants and very limited intercontinental and intra-Asian travel.
We anticipate a stronger performance toward the end of the year.
As Bob pointed out, our fourth quarter should be stronger than our third, despite the fact that certain inflationary costs will remain a headwind, especially labor and likely transportation.
To mitigate those effects, we aim to implement further price adjustments where necessary to pass on these costs.
As we look out further, vaccine distributions will eventually be more widespread and successful, and life will eventually return to more normal experiences, with more robust social activities and international travel.
Our business is built for the long haul.
As I mentioned earlier, because of our breadth across attractive markets, we are able to generate growth even when conditions are not always ordinary in each market.
We will continue to focus on sustainable growth and returns across all areas of our business and anticipate that our consolidated margins will improve as we transition to a more balanced and steady growth pattern.
The long-term outlook for our company has not changed and remains quite promising.
We are making strategic investments today that will further strengthen our competitive position, including expanding capacity in key high-growth regions and markets.
