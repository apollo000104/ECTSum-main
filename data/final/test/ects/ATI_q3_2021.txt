Today's discussion is being broadcast on our website.
Participating in today's call are Bob Wetherbee, Board Chair President and CEO; and Don Newman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Bob and Don will focus on our third quarter highlights and key messages, but may refer to certain slides within their remarks.
These slides are available on our website.
They provide additional color and details on our results and outlook.
It feels great to report that we returned to profitability in the third quarter, three months ahead of our expectations.
This was no small achievement, as we overcame pandemic-induced disruptions, a three-plus month labor strike and the challenges inherent in significant business transformation.
Our success is due in equal parts to accelerated rates of recovery in our diverse end markets, our significant business restructuring and transformation efforts and the perseverance of the ATI team.
Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.05.
EPS improve to $0.35 per share when you factor in the net positive impacts from settling our recent labor strike, including the benefits from our new collective bargaining agreement, and the lingering strike-related costs as well as the gain from the Flowform Products divestiture.
I'm proud of what our team has accomplished, overcoming the challenges of the past two years.
We're winning on the top line through new business and by capturing share gains.
We're winning on the bottom line by tightly managing costs and solidifying our financial foundation.
We've begun to pivot to growth.
We're excited about what we can achieve as the commercial aerospace recovery accelerates and our business operates at high utilization levels.
Before I dig into our performance and outlook by end market, I'll provide a progress update on a few of our strategic initiatives.
First, we took another step in our ongoing business transformation.
We sold our Flowform business for $55 million, resulting in a gain on sale of nearly $14 million.
While this business primarily serves the defense market, it had little connection to the broader ATI.
There were a few material synergies, and its long-term success was linked to specific program volumes rather than our material science.
The new owner will be better placed to invest for its future.
Second, we've built upon our firm financial foundation by taking steps to reduce earnings volatility and cash flow variability and increase financial flexibility.
I don't want to steal a lot of Don's highlights here, so I'll limit my comments.
We successfully tapped the favorable debt markets to our advantage.
We significantly extended our debt maturities by redeeming notes due in 2023.
At the same time, we added new notes due in 2029 and 2031.
A portion of these proceeds were used to support a voluntary pension contribution.
As a result of these third quarter actions, annual interest expense will decrease by about $6 million and pension funding levels improve.
Third, as a visible next step in our continuing journey to become one ATI, we promoted Kim Fields to serve as Chief Operating Officer effective January 2022.
This officially recognizes the role she's been serving in since December 2020, leading both business segments.
Kim's doing a great job aligning the businesses, accelerating execution and streamlining material flows.
As markets recover and asset utilization increases, we're better positioned to expand margins and improve cash generation under her leadership.
Lastly, we continue to make progress on strategically transforming our Specialty Rolled Products business, taking deliberate actions to create a competitive cost structure.
This began last December when we announced our plans to exit low-margin standard stainless sheet products.
It includes closing five facilities and concurrently streamlining and upgrading our high-value material flow paths.
Those efforts are largely on track.
I'll have more on that in a moment.
In July, we reached agreement with Specialty Rolled Products union representative employees, ending their 3.5-month strike.
Together, we signed a contract that rewards our employees for their important contributions to ATI's overall success.
The SRP business is now positioned to be successful in the long term.
I'm pleased to say that by the end of September, we've ramped SRP's production rates back to pre-strike levels, with one exception that we're working hard to address.
The SRP team did an outstanding job safely getting back on track, accelerating production to meet strong customer demand.
You might wonder where we stand on our decision to exit standard stainless sheet products given the current strong market demand.
History reminds us, this is a temporary upswing in a highly cyclical business with chronically low margins and high fixed costs.
Our commitment to exit hasn't wavered, but our time line has extended by three to five months due to the strike-related impacts.
First, the strike caused us to slow aerospace qualification activities across SRP operations.
It also created significant product backlog destined for strategic customers.
As a result, at facilities slated for closure, we'll extend a few select operations into the second quarter of 2022.
I would have preferred to stay on our original time line.
We're committed to better position our customers for the accelerating economic recovery and take near-term advantage where current market conditions offer a valuable upside.
The savings capture will be slowed by a quarter or two.
So let me be clear, the overall favorable economics attached to our transformation over the long run remain in place.
Turning to our third quarter performance and outlook by market.
We're seeing clear evidence of recovery.
Momentum is building as volumes return to pre-pandemic demand levels.
Let's start with our largest end market, commercial aerospace.
Expansion continues unevenly across our product portfolio.
In the jet engine market, forgings demand grew for the fourth quarter in a row.
This expansion was driven by demand for narrowbody engines, coupled with our 2021 market share gains.
Our Q3 results included initial LEAP-1B volume increases to support the expected 737 MAX production ramp.
In contrast to forgings, our sequential jet engine Specialty Materials sales declined somewhat.
While it appears that our customers' jet engine material inventories are nearing a low point, it's clear that pockets of inventory exist.
We also believe there's widespread customer desire to tightly manage year-end inventory levels.
We predict these inventory stockpiles will be fully depleted soon, as OEM production rate increases materialize.
We expect customer hesitancy to wane over the next few quarters and order patterns to reflect underlying demand once again.
Lastly, on Commercial Aerospace.
Our airframe business expanded sequentially for two reasons: first, post-strike recovery efforts in our SRP business; and second, the increasing orders associated with our new European OEM long-term agreement.
Year-over-year airframe sales declined.
We expect this market to continue at low levels in Q4 and into 2022 as international travel rates recover more slowly and 787 deliveries remain on hold.
Despite the mixed third quarter aerospace performance, there's good news on the horizon.
As the COVID Delta variant impact slows and international travel restrictions ease, customers are once again returning to the skies.
This market is already displaying strong recovery trends in the form of increased domestic passenger travel, higher global cargo volumes and accelerated fleet retirements.
Moving to the defense market.
Revenue declined sequentially, largely due to customer shipment timing and the sale of our Flowform business.
Year-over-year growth was strong.
What's driving growth in the near term?
Titanium armor for land-based vehicle programs in the U.S. and the U.K., military jet engine sales and the expansion of new helicopter programs.
Longer term, we remain highly confident in ATI defense growth.
Our confidence stems from a wide range of new programs and opportunities that can benefit from our advanced materials development and production capabilities.
Turning to the energy markets.
We saw significant growth sequentially and year-over-year in both business segments.
This occurred in oil and gas as well as specialty energy.
In our Advanced Alloys & Solutions segment, we produced and shipped most of a large nickel alloy project destined for offshore waters in South America.
In our High Performance Materials & Components segment, strong demand continued for our nickel products used in land-based gas turbine production in Asia.
The near-term outlook for our energy markets is solid.
Global GDP growth and higher travel rates will increase energy demand clearly.
Sustainability trends will drive exploration and production of more environmentally friendly energy generation and transmission technologies.
All of these are best served with our unique high-performance materials.
Let's wrap up our market discussion with our critical applications used in medical and electronics.
In medical, sales grew sequentially and year-over-year.
Increased demand for biomedical implant materials was driven by low post-pandemic customer inventory levels and increased elective surgery volumes.
In Q4, we expect these trends to continue and likely expand to include MRI-related materials.
Electronic sales were lower compared to the record-setting levels of the previous quarter and last year, but still very strong.
The strong demand for other key end markets required production allocations within our China Precision Rolled Strip facility, constraining, within the quarter, available capacity for electronics products.
We also had a planned Q3 maintenance outage at our Oregon facility.
Underlying customer demand for electronics remains strong and should continue.
I'll wrap up my opening comments by saying I'm confidently bullish on ATI's future.
Our end markets are recovering.
We're growing our market share.
We've aggressively locked in cost-structure improvements.
We have significant growth opportunities on the horizon.
We've put ourselves in a position to accelerate growth and expand margins.
We're executing to win.
It's an exciting time for ATI.
I'm proud to lead this team as we achieve our goal of becoming a premier supplier of aerospace and defense materials.
Bob already gave you my opening line.
ATI returned to profitability in the third quarter, three months ahead of our expectations.
A lot of hard work went into rightsizing the business and putting us on this path for growth.
We'll celebrate for a moment, but in reality, we've already shifted our focus to capitalizing on this momentum, further expanding our business and generating shareholder value.
Now for the details.
Overall, Q3 revenue increased to $726 million, up 18% sequentially and 21% year-over-year.
Q3-adjusted EBITDA grew to $80 million, up 49% sequentially and up 381% year-over-year.
Q3 performance suggests a revenue run rate approaching $3 billion and an adjusted EBITDA run rate of $320 million.
On a reported basis, ATI earned $0.35 per share in the third quarter.
We earned $0.05 per share in the quarter after adjusting for a net $43 million of special items.
These included gains for post-retirement medical benefits, resulting from the new SRP collective bargaining agreement and from Flowform products divestiture.
Strike-related costs were also excluded.
To better understand our results, I'll provide some color around each segment's performance.
Starting with AA&S, sales grew by 35% sequentially and EBITDA by nearly 60% versus the prior quarter.
Within the segment, the SRP team did an outstanding job accelerating post-strike production levels.
This was against a backdrop of strong customer demand and elevated pricing opportunities.
Their efforts produced tangible results, bringing us back to first quarter 2021 production rates by the end of September, as we had predicted.
Our Precision Rolled Strip business in China once again had record sales and earnings due to continued strong demand across a variety of end markets.
AA&S segment Q3 performance also compared favorably to Q3 2020.
Revenue increased $49 million, and EBITDA increased $46 million.
This impressive earnings growth was powered by increased market demand, higher HRPF toll conversion volumes, streamlined cost structures and metal price tailwinds.
HPMC Q3 sales and earnings were in line with the second quarter and much improved from the third quarter of 2020.
Sequential forgings growth from commercial and military jet engine sales was offset by a quarter-over-quarter decline in Specialty Materials jet engine revenues and the impact of selling our Flowform business in Q3.
Earnings and margins were consistent sequentially.
We offset a weaker product mix, driven by increased energy market sales with operational cost improvements.
HPMC sales were higher year-over-year in every major market, led by commercial aerospace.
Earnings and margins expanded significantly in Q3 versus the same quarter in 2020.
This is a result of our decisive 2020 cost-cutting actions, jet engine share gains and contractual margin improvements.
Let's move to the balance sheet.
Late in the third quarter, we issued two debt tranches totaling $675 million.
$325 million of the notes are due in 2029 and bear interest at 4.875%.
$350 million of the notes are due in 2031 and bear interest at 5.125%.
Proceeds from these notes were largely used to redeem $500 million of notes due in 2023, bearing a 7.875% interest rate.
The financing brings several benefits, including $6 million in annual cash interest savings, significantly lower interest rates and a much improved debt maturity schedule.
Excess proceeds from the financing were largely used to support a $50 million voluntary pension contribution in the quarter.
I will come back to our pension glide path in a moment.
After redeeming the 2023 notes in mid-October, we had more than $800 million of liquidity, including approximately $440 million of cash on hand.
Third quarter managed working capital levels improved sequentially, but remained above our target.
This was largely due to SRP strike recovery efforts.
Q3 SRP sales were back-end loaded, increasing quarter-end accounts receivable.
We also ramped production in the quarter, but we're unable to fully eliminate inventory backlogs before quarter end.
We expect significant reductions in managed working capital levels, well below 40% of revenue across the company in Q4.
Our $50 million voluntary contribution is the latest action in our plan to improve pension funding levels and reduce related expenses and contributions over time.
In the third quarter, we completed our fifth pension annuitization effort.
This lowers overall participation by nearly 1,000 people and shifts approximately $70 million of assets and liabilities to a third party.
We have seen favorable asset returns and planned discount rate movements so far in 2021.
If that holds through the end of the year, we may see a meaningful improvement in our pension-funded status at the close of 2021.
Now let's take a few minutes to discuss fourth quarter outlook.
In HPMC, we expect the jet engine-driven recovery to accelerate and broaden across our product portfolio.
After several strong quarters, sales to specialty energy markets will likely decline.
We anticipate continued commercial aerospace forgings growth.
We also expect additional defense sales and to benefit from a large discrete commercial space project.
These changes should result in improved mix sequentially.
For AA&S, we anticipate improved financial results in our SA&C business.
This is due to defense and medical volumes increasing and expenses decreasing after our seasonal Q3 maintenance outage.
In our SRP business, several pieces of equipment will take extended outages in the fourth quarter in support of our strategic transformation.
First, we'll idle a finishing line to upgrade its high-value specialty materials capabilities; and second, we'll idle a melt asset to allow finishing operations to process post-strike backlogs.
The outages are expected to negatively impact cost absorption and increase cash expense in the fourth quarter.
We anticipate a return-to-normal capacity levels in Q1 2022.
Lastly, we anticipate our China Precision Rolled Strip business to experience its normal seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter due to lower post-holiday electronics demand.
Additionally, we expect to recognize a $7 million benefit in the fourth quarter from a retroactive 2021 tax credit in China.
In aggregate, we anticipate building on our improved Q3 results on both the top and bottom line.
We expect to report adjusted earnings between $0.07 and $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter, despite the SRP strategic outage costs.
Incremental margins will fully reflect our cost structure leverage as sales expand, largely in our HPMC segment.
This growth should propel our fourth quarter earnings to 2021's high point and lead to further profit expansion in 2022.
This guidance range translates into a year-end EBITDA exit rate that's more than three times greater than year-end 2020.
In other words, in four quarters, we've more than tripled our earnings trajectory.
As Bob said earlier, it's an exciting time to be at ATI.
We are back in the black and see a steady climb out of the 2020 earnings trough.
Before I hand the call back to Bob, I want to affirm the free cash flow guidance provided in early 2021.
Excluding pension contributions, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year 2021.
The team has worked hard to put us in a position to be successful, and they are committed.
Work remains to close out the year, but I'm confident that we'll hit the mark.
We demonstrated significant progress in the third quarter and fully expect to exit the year on a high note.
I'll close with four important points.
Number one, ATI is focused on growth with the cost structure we need for success.
Number two, we're well positioned in key markets to achieve higher than GDP growth over the long term.
Number three, transformation of our product mix is largely on track and will deliver significant benefits.
And number four, our people, the ATI team are the core of our competitive advantage.
Together, we've accomplished much during an extended period of uncertainty, challenge and change.
I laugh a little when I hear financial experts and market pundits describe what we've collectively weathered as headwinds.
That's a tad bit understated.
The ATI team has persevered to do what needed to be done, working safely and responding with urgency, always with the long-term interest of the company and our shareholders in mind.
Has it been easy?
Have we occasionally had to first convince ourselves it was possible and that we could do it?
But to be clear, we've done what needed to be done.
I'm proud of what we've accomplished together.
With a clear strategy and consistent focused execution, we're accelerating our velocity to a very successful future.
