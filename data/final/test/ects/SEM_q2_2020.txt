Before outlining some of our operational metrics I want to provide you with some summary comments regarding the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.
First, let me say how proud I am of the operational leadership and clinical excellence I have seen throughout organizations these last several months.
And these unusual times it is gratifying to see such a dedicated group of clinicians and support staff come together throughout our organization to provide the highest quality care while keeping our patients and staff safe.
We continue to adapt, evolve and innovate as we navigate through the pandemic.
As I mentioned on our last earnings call, the effect of the pandemic began to impact our company in mid-March.
I also mentioned we thought April would represent the low point for our business, and we would begin to see a rebound in the areas of our business hardest hit by these disruptions.
In our critical illness recovery hospitals, we have held steady during the second quarter on census and our occupancy in light of some of the challenges COVID presents, while our cost of care has increased, we have seen increased occupancy and revenues every month throughout the pandemic.
In our rehabilitation hospitals, we had to temporarily restricted missions in our New Jersey and Miami markets in April and early May due to COVID outbreaks in those regions.
This had the effect of reduced volume and higher cost in those markets.
We also incurred additional cost to care for our patients and other markets.
Having said that, we saw a significant rebound in this business segment in June, as revenue increased over 24% for the month on the same period year-over-year basis.
Our June occupancy rate is -- of 78% is close to pre-COVID levels and exceeded June's last year occupancy of 73%.
In our outpatient rehabilitation and Concentra segments, volumes continue to be our biggest challenge.
As we mentioned, last quarter volumes have been negatively impacted by a number of issues in both segments, some of which have lessened as we've progressed throughout the second quarter.
Our outpatient rehabilitation volumes and revenues were down year over year 48% and 44% respectively in the month of April and May resulting in adjusted EBITDA losses in both of those months in our outpatient rehab segment.
In June however we saw meaningful improvement as states began to ease restrictions in hospitals and surgery centers began performing elective surgeries again.
