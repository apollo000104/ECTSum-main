I know that we're reporting on the second quarter 2021 today.
But we're super excited about what we see for the second half of this year.
We advertised that we were front-end loading our capex in 2021 through the first half of the year, which we did.
And now we see and actually have it today, corporate record high natural gas production and Comstock that we are selling at high natural gas prices.
Global demand for natural gas is very strong for industrial power generation as well as electrical demand for cooling and heating, while supply is low-to-moderate in part due to the disciplined use of capital expenditure dollars across the entire oil and gas sector, as you are all aware of in this earnings season.
Our corporate strength lies in our best-in-class, low-cost structure, which creates our high margins as well as the 1,900 plus net drilling locations within our 3000 to 323,000 net acre Haynesville/Bossier footprint, which we operate 91% of.
One of the major tasks in 2021 was reduce our cost of capital, which we took mighty steps forward with our 5.875% senior notes being issued in the second quarter 2021.
We do feel the wind in our sails as we look at the third and fourth quarter of 2021 and 2022 and want to recommit to you with our goal of reducing our leverage ratio to less than two times at the end of 2022 or before if possible.
With the refinancing in place, we reduced our interest costs per mcfe by 25% this quarter to $0.36 and are committed to continue working to reduce that number by year-end 2021, if possible.
The denominator of Comstock is our consistent drilling results quarter after quarter after quarter in a Tier one Haynesville/Bossier region, which speaks volumes about all of our departments, especially our operations department.
And through our quality Haynesville/Bossier rock, that we have decades of that quality rock lift to drill.
I know that, that denominator is why Jerry Jones and his family invested $1 billion in Comstock since August 2018, and we believe that is why you, the bondholders, banks and equity owners buy Comstock, proven rock quality, proven results over many, many years.
Now I'll start the formal second quarter 2021 results.
I am Jay Allison, Chief Executive Officer of Comstock.
And with me is Roland Burns, our present office -- Operating Officer; and Ron Mills, our VP of Finance and Investor Relations.
While we believe the expectations and such statements to be reasonable, there could be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
Now if we'll go over to the second quarter 2021 highlights.
We cover the highlights of the second quarter on slide three.
In the second quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $55 million or $0.22 per diluted share.
Production for the quarter averaged approximately 1.4 bcfe a day and was 98% natural gas.
Our average daily production for the quarter was 8% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 6% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Revenues, including realized hedging losses were $325 million, 40% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDAX of $251 million was 55% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $196 million or $0.71 per diluted share.
For the quarter, we generated $20 million of free cash flow as the preferred dividends, increasing our year-to-year free cash flow to $53 million.
That's a good start toward reaching our annual free cash flow generation goal of over $200 million.
With the stronger commodity prices we're seeing in the second half of the year, we now expect free cash flow to come in well above that goal of $200 million.
And lastly, we completed the task of refinancing all of our higher coupon senior notes in the second quarter, which substantially reduced our cost of capital going forward.
If you turn over to slide four, we recap the refinancing transaction, which closed on June 28.
We issued $965 million of new 5.875% senior notes, which are due in 2030.
The proceeds from the offering were used to redeem the remainder of our 9.75 quarter bonds.
The refinancing transaction reduced our reported annual interest expense by $33 million, and we will save $28 million in annual cash interest payments.
Combined with the March refinancing that we did, our annual interest payments were reduced by $48 million.
The lower cash interest expense will also drive significant improvements in our cash interest costs per mcfe produced, as I mentioned earlier, on a pro forma basis, assuming the refinancing was completed at the beginning of the quarter.
Our second quarter interest cost for mcfe would have been $0.36 per mcfe as compared to a $0.48 rate in the first quarter.
In addition to lowering our cost of capital, we also improved our weighted average maturity of our senior notes to 7.6 years, up from 6.3 years.
On slide five, we summarize our reported financial results for this recently completed second quarter.
We had a solid quarter, and it was driven by that 6% production increase in combination with stronger oil and gas prices than we had last year.
Ore production for the second quarter totaled 100 -- our total production for the second quarter totaled 124 bcf of natural gas and 362,000 barrels of oil.
Like Jay said, this was 6% higher than we had in the second quarter of 2020, and it's an 8% increase over where we were in the first quarter of this year.
Our oil and gas sales, as a result, including the realized losses from our hedging program, increased by 40% to $325 million.
Oil prices averaged $55.82 per barrel, and our gas price averaged $2.46 per mcfe; both of those numbers, including the impact of our hedges.
Natural gas prices were 31% better than we realized last year in the same second quarter of last year.
Remember that NYMEX -- the NYMEX contract for the quarter only averaged $2.83.
So I know the recent run-up in gas prices is really -- you'll really see those numbers starting in July forward.
Looking at the cost side, our production costs were up about 6%, kind of matching the increase in production.
Our G&A was down 5%, and our noncash depreciation, depletion and amortization was up 18% in the quarter.
Our adjusted EBITDAX came in at $251 million; it's 55% higher than the second quarter of last year.
Operating cash flow was $196 million, 67% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
We did report a net loss of $184 million in the second quarter or $0.80 per share, but that was all due to a very large mark-to-market loss on our hedge contracts of $205 million and a $114 million charge related to the early retirement of the senior notes from our June 28 refinancing transaction.
Adjusted net income, excluding the mark-to-market unrealized hedging loss and the loss on early retirement of debt and certain other unusual items, was a profit of $55 million or $0.22 per fully diluted share.
On slide six, we summarize the financial results for the first half of this year.
For the first six months of the year, production totaled 241.5 bcfe.
That includes 688,000 barrels of oil, and that's about 1% lower than our production for the first half of 2020.
But our oil and gas sales, including any realized hedging losses were $657 million, which is 30% higher than the first half of 2020.
Oil prices for the first half of this year have averaged $52.06 per barrel.
That's 22% higher than last year, and our realized gas prices averaged $2.62 per mcf; both of those numbers, including the impact of our hedging, and that's up 34% over last year.
For the first half of this year, we've reported adjusted EBITDAX of $513 million, 41% higher than the same period last year.
Operating cash flow was $403 million, 47% higher than last year.
And then overall, for this period, we reported a loss of $322.5 million or $1.39 per share.
Again, this was due to the charges for the early extinguishment of debt related to both the March and June refinancings and that mark-to-market unrealized loss on our hedge position.
Excluding those items, our adjusted net income would be $118 million profit or $0.46 per diluted share.
slide seven, we recap our hedging program.
During the second quarter, we had 68% of our gas volumes hedged.
That reduced our realized gas price that $2.46 per mcfe from the actual $2.59 for mcfe we realized from selling our gas production.
We also had about 38% of our oil volumes hedged, which decreased our realized oil price to $55.82 per barrel versus the $61.25 we actually realized.
Overall, our hedging program resulted in realized losses of $18.8 million in the quarter.
For the remainder of this year, we have natural gas hedges covering 976 million cubic feet per day, which is around 70% of our expected production in the second half of this year.
59% of those hedges are fixed price swaps, but 41% are collars, which give us exposure to the higher prices we're now seeing.
For 2022 or next year, we have about 40% to 45% of our expected production hedged.
And almost half of those or 49% are in the form of collars, which give us substantial exposure to the higher prices that we're kind of now seeing for next year.
On slide eight, we summarized the shut-in activity during the second quarter.
And we had a good quarter on this front.
We had only 52 million a day shut-in during the second quarter, which is 3.8% of our production, and that came down substantially from the 6.4% we had shut-in, in the first quarter.
There really were no significant disruptions due to storms or other matters in the quarter and the shut-ins that we had were very routine and related primarily to production we shut-in to conduct offset frac activity.
On slide nine, we detail our operating cost per mcfe.
We had a good quarter there.
Our operating cost per mcfe averaged $0.54 in the second quarter, and that was $0.01 lower than the first quarter rate.
Gathering costs were $0.25, taxes $0.08 and the other lifting cost in the field were $0.21, very comparable to the first quarter rates.
Slide 10, on corporate overhead per mcfe.
That, again, came in at $0.05 in the second quarter.
It's one of the lowest in the industry.
And again, very, very consistent to what we expected and what we've had in the past.
We do expect cash G&A to remain in this $0.05 to $0.07 range kind of going forward.
That's the depreciation, depletion and amortization per mcfe produced.
That came in at $0.96 in the second quarter.
It was $0.01 higher than the $0.95 rate we had in the first quarter of this year.
It's a picture of our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and it reflects our June 28 refinancing transaction, which closed right at the end of the month -- right at the end of the quarter.
So we ended the quarter with $475 million drawn on our revolving credit facility, which is a $1.4 billion borrowing base.
And we expect to continue to reduce that as we generate free cash flow the rest of the year.
That's really -- free cash flow is being really designated to continue to reduce our debt.
We now have in total about $2.459 billion of senior notes outstanding.
They're comprised of $244 million of the 7.5% senior notes, which are due in 2025.
We assumed as part of the Covey Park acquisition, $1.25 billion of new 6.75% senior notes due in 2029 that we issued in March.
And then the new $965 million of new 5.875 senior notes due in 2030 that were issued right at the end of the second quarter.
We currently plan to retire the 2025 7.5% bonds, probably sometime early next year, just using -- targeting the free cash flow that's generated and using that as a permanent debt reduction moved by the company.
We do -- on Slide 12, you can see our new revised maturity schedule.
And so you can see now that our weighted average maturity of our senior notes is now 7.6 years after the recent refinancing, right at the end of the second quarter.
So we're in great shape on the maturity schedule.
And as Jay pointed out, have substantially improved our cost of capital and generated substantial annual interest savings on what otherwise would be dollars that would have to go for fixed charges on our debt service.
So we did end the quarter with about $20 million in cash on the balance sheet.
So our current liquidity is at $945 million.
Slide 13, we recapped the second quarter capital expenditures.
So in the second quarter, we spent $165 million on our development activities and $154 million of that relates to our operated Haynesville shale properties.
So we drilled 21 or 15.7 net operated horizontal Haynesville wells, and then we returned 16 or 14.2 net operated Haynesville wells to sales in the recently completed second quarter.
We also spent about $10.9 million on nonoperated activity and other development activity.
In addition to funding our development program, we've also invested $7.6 million on leasing new exploratory acreage.
Given the tremendous success of that leasing program, we have decided to increase our budget up to a maximum of $20 million to spend on putting new leases in to support our Haynesville shale drilling program in the future.
As we're seeing very good opportunities to do that at attractive terms.
So right now, as Dan will go over in a minute, we're currently operating five operated drilling rigs for our 2021 program, and we see kind of maintaining those five as we look ahead into 2022.
So we're at a very good consistent level, we think, which is right for the company.
So based on this current operating plan, we expect to spend about $525 million to $560 million on this year's drilling plan, which will drill 55 net wells and turned to sales about 48 net wells.
This is a small increase from what we expected at the beginning of the year.
Most of that is really due to changes in the timing of when completions happen and then also higher-than-expected nonoperated activity.
We definitely are very focused on generating significant free cash flow.
And with the current gas prices, we now anticipate significantly exceeding our original target of $200 million of free cash flow for this year.
We'll use that incremental free cash flow to accelerate the delevering of our balance sheet.
Flip over on slide 14.
You'll see the map outlined in the summary of our new well completions.
Since the last call, we've turned 21 new additional wells to sales.
The 21 wells were tested at rates ranging from 15 million cubic feet a day up to 32 million cubic feet a day with a 22 million cubic feet per day average IP rate.
The wells at lateral lengths ranging from 4,580 feet all the way up to 11,388 feet, and we had an average for the quarter of -- or for this list of 8,251 feet.
So in addition to the wells we have listed here, we currently have 13 additional wells that we have in various stages of completion.
Regarding the activity levels this past May, we did drop down from six to five rigs.
That's where we are today, and we intend to hold our activity flat at this level for the remainder of the year and into next year.
Our fiscal DUC count currently stands at 23 wells, and we're currently we're actively running three frac crews.
Over on slide 15, as an updated DNC call stream for our benchmark long lateral wells.
These are our laterals greater than 8,000 feet in length.
Through the end of the second quarter, 73% of all the wells turned to sales this year have been long lateral wells.
During the second quarter, our total D&C cost averaged $1,051 a foot.
This represents a 3% increase compared to the first quarter.
And is 2% higher than the full year 2020 total D&C cost.
Our drilling costs in the second quarter increased by 7% compared to the first quarter.
This is primarily attributable to a lower average lateral length versus the first quarter, but still 15% less than our drilling cost in 2020.
Our completion costs remained relatively flat with only a 2% increase from the first quarter.
But we're still running 16% higher than 2020.
And this is due to the large number of the smaller fracs that were pumped in 2020, which led to the lower cost last year, lower completion costs.
For the remainder of the year, we expect our completion costs will remain relatively flat, and we do not foresee any material increase in costs.
So by building on our basin leading drilling performance and keeping our current completion cost in check, we expect to maintain our total D&C cost for our benchmark long lateral wells in this 1,025, 1,050 foot range.
Also, I want to add that we're currently drilling two, 15,000 foot laterals that we spud in June.
This is the first for the company.
We expect to complete these wells during the fourth quarter.
We also have two additional 15,000 foot wells that we will spud later this month that will be completed in the first quarter of next year.
These longer laterals are going to help bolster our efforts to further increase our lateral lengths and to drive down our credit costs; drive down the footage cost further than where we've been.
So that summarizes the operations.
Okay, Dan, that's short and sweet.
It's usually about ten pages, and we've condensed it.
That's a good report and Roland, same here.
If you look at the 2021 outlook, I'd like to direct you to slide 16, where we summarize our outlook for the remainder of this year.
Our operating plan for this year is expected to provide for around 8% to maybe 10% production growth and most importantly, generate in excess as Roland said, $200 million of free cash flow and maybe a lot more than that.
Our primary focus this year is to improve our balance sheet, reduce our leverage and lower our cost of capital, which we've made great strides on that.
Our June refinancing transaction was another significant step to reducing our cost of capital with the $28 million annual savings and interest payments.
Now we will primarily focus on absolute debt reduction, and we'll seek to retire, as Roland said, our 2025 bonds with free cash flow that we generate the rest of this year.
If natural gas prices stay at current levels, we would expect our leverage ratio to improve to less than a 2.5 times at the end of 2021, down from that $3.8 million at the end of 2020.
And based on our current plans and the price outlook, we'd anticipate our leverage ratio further improving it to less than two times at the end of 2022.
We remain focused on maintaining and improving our industry-leading low-cost structure and best-in-class well drilling returns with our industry-leading low-cost structure, our Haynesville drilling program generates some of the highest drilling returns in all of North America.
Our large inventory of Haynesville/Bossier drilling locations provide us with decades of drilling inventory.
We'll also focus on lowering our greenhouse gas emissions and are currently evaluating participating in one of the programs to certify our gas as responsibly sourced and we have very strong liquidity, as Roland mentioned, at $945 million.
On the guidance page, we just update the guidance for the remainder of this year.
Production guidance remains at the 1.33 to 1.425 bcfe per day number that we had previously provided.
As mentioned on the call, our development capex guidance is $525 million to $560 million.
And we anticipate on remaining at the five rigs we're currently running over the remainder of the year.
And at the same time, as mentioned earlier, the leasing capital has increased to $15 million to $20 million as we continue to add acreage.
On the cost side, LOE, GTC, really all the cost items remain unchanged from the prior quarter.
And so there's -- we continue to hit all of our targets on the cost side.
