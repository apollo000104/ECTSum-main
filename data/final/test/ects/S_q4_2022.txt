In connection with our recently announced definitive agreement to acquire Attivo, management will provide additional information as to the benefits of the acquisition.
However, we'll not factor the planned acquisition into our fiscal '23 guidance at this time.
We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
This was another excellent quarter, and I'm extremely proud of the entire SentinelOne team.
Our ARR grew 123% year over year in the fourth quarter, making the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth.
In today's digital world, cybersecurity is mission-critical infrastructure in every geography, industry vertical and organization size.
The demand environment remains incredibly strong.
We continue to scale our business as a result of our cutting-edge autonomous XDR platform and our powerful partner-supported go-to-market strategy.
We've built an AI-driven security platform that spans endpoint, cloud, IoT, data and now also identity.
I'm thrilled that today, we announced our plan to acquire Attivo Networks.
Attivo is a premier and highly differentiated solution that will enable us to provide cybersecurity in one of the most critical and dynamic parts of enterprise security today, the identity parameter.
With Attivo's user-centric identity capabilities, we will be able to support an even more comprehensive zero trust framework.
I'd also encourage everyone to read our shareholder letter we published on our Investor Relations website, which provides a lot more detail.
Let's take a look back at our fiscal '22.
It was a groundbreaking year for SentinelOne.
We started the year as a private company, delivered a triple-digit revenue and ARR growth rate through all four quarters and ended the year as one of the fastest-growing technology companies in public markets with outstanding growth in ARR rapidly approaching $300 million.
Throughout the year, we celebrated accomplishments that highlight our product market fit, innovation and superb customer experience, such as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection, highest scores in Gartner Critical Capabilities use cases and being the only vendor with 100% visibility and no misdetection in the latest MITRE evaluation.
Our fourth quarter and fiscal '22 results demonstrate the relentless execution of our teams and focus on innovation.
We're protecting more enterprises today than ever before at faster speed, greater scale, higher accuracy and with more automation.
Automation has never been more critical to tackle the complexity of today's threats.
I'd like to dig deeper into three key points about our performance.
First, our success with large enterprises underscores the scalability of our platform.
We added a record number of $100,000-plus ARR deals, a record number of million dollar-plus ARR customers and closed our largest ever net new customer contract, one of the most influential and leading global Internet companies.
Nick will discuss this in more detail later on.
Second, we paired our phenomenal growth with significant progress toward our long-term profitability targets.
I'm pleased to share that we ended the fourth quarter with double-digit year-over-year improvement in both our gross and operating margins.
Our gross margins expanded 12 percentage points year over year, and our operating margin improved 38%.
This progress reflects our growing scale and increasing efficiency.
Looking at the full year, fiscal '22 was an investment year for SentinelOne.
It featured our IPO, solidifying our brand as an industry leader, as well as investments in our go-to-market and innovation engines.
We doubled our total workforce.
I'm proud of SentinelOne being named to Comparably's Best Company Culture List and receiving the 2021 Great Places to Work award.
Given the significant market opportunity ahead, we remain committed to investing in the growth of our business.
And just like we did last year, we intend to balance this growth with further margin improvement in fiscal '23.
Finally, our business is performing extremely well with broad-based strength across new customer adds, existing customer renewals and upsells.
Throughout the year, we significantly expanded our platform offerings.
Our endpoint solution remains the primary driver of our business, which is being complemented by emerging growth vectors, including cloud, IoT and data.
We're still in the early innings of a large and expanding total market driven by the proliferation of hybrid work environment, digital transformation and an evolving threat landscape.
It's clear that we achieved a lot as a company in the past year, but we must remain as vigilant as ever around the threat landscape.
The persistence and sophistication of new attacks continues.
We entered 2021 on the heels of Sunburst and exited the year battling Log4j.
And most recently, the potential for cyber warfare has significantly increased in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
This has further escalated the threat environment.
Our vision is to be a force for good, and we're committed to doing our part to help affected people and businesses in Ukraine and around the world to stay cyber secure.
We've established a Ukraine Crisis Resource Center and began offering free access to Singularity XDR for cyber threat protection in Ukraine.
We ran similar programs to help others in the wake of Sunburst, and we're committed to defending against cyber warfare.
Threat sharing and collaboration are essential to our collective mission against cyber attacks.
Our teams at SentinelLabs are leading the way by uncovering some of the most sophisticated attacks across the world.
Our global footprint puts us in a unique position to not only protect our customer base in real time but also produce novel research to educate and arm the cybersecurity community.
We're able to leverage the power of our partner ecosystem to stay on the front line with leading incident response providers like Mandiant, KPMG, Kroll, RSA and many others.
As an example, we recently named and published research on HermeticWiper related to the escalating cyber attacks surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
This was a real-time discovery on the eve of Russia's ground invasion.
It helped bring awareness to cyber attacks accompanying modern warfare.
Our publication was followed by an alert notice from Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, highlighting the significance and relevance of SentinelLabs' research.
If we look at the evolution of cybersecurity technologies for a moment, it's clear that legacy AV represents the past, EDR is the present and XDR is the future.
While the majority of enterprises still utilize legacy AV solutions, we have undoubtedly entered the XDR era.
At SentinelOne, we established the foundations of XDR by pioneering the world's first purpose-built AI-powered autonomous cybersecurity platform.
Singularity XDR brings the critical capabilities customers need from a comprehensive cybersecurity platform: speed, scale and automation.
Enterprises are increasingly selecting SentinelOne for our best-of-breed XDR. Over the past year, we significantly broadened our platform capabilities by introducing several mission-critical and highly differentiated innovations.
I will briefly highlight a few of these.
First, we enhanced our network visibility and control capabilities with Ranger Pro.
Ranger helps enterprises eliminate one of the most commonly exploited threat vectors: unprotected and rogue assets.
It reduces the attack surface by offering device mapping and management capabilities.
Second, we introduced Storyline Active Response, our engine for automated threat hunting, detection and response.
Next, we developed Remote Script Orchestration, a powerful endpoint management tool for both IR partners and enterprises.
Finally, we launched Singularity Mobile, a new AI-powered mobile security solution for iOS, Android and Chrome OS devices.
Building upon the acquisition of Scalyr, we launched DataSet in February of this year, a revolutionary live enterprise data platform for data queries, analytics, insights and data retention.
DataSet expands our capabilities beyond cybersecurity use cases.
It's a cloud-native, flexible enterprise data platform built for petabyte scale.
Not only DataSet is the back end for our Singularity XDR platform.
The technology is already being used by hundreds of enterprises, analyzing trillions of real-time events.
Customers like DoorDash, Copart, Asana, TomTom and many others are selecting DataSet to unlock the power of their own data with speed, scalability and technology-driven cost advantages.
Our platform approach is resonating and is contributing meaningfully to our financial performance.
Endpoint continues to fuel the company's growth.
At the same time, we're seeing outstanding traction with our adjacent platform technologies and capabilities.
Over a third of our fourth quarter new business was driven by our Singularity modules and DataSet, up from about 20% a year ago.
Across all of our capabilities, our cloud workload protection and data retention modules have been the most outstanding, each delivering year-over-year ACV growth of over 10x.
Let me spend a second on cloud security.
This is one of the fastest-growing markets in security today, and we're already doing extremely well on this front.
Demand for our cloud workload protection solution has been broad-based, both within our installed base, as well as with new customers.
Cloud security represents a sizable opportunity for SentinelOne for years to come.
And today, we are further expanding our addressable market and extending our XDR platform capabilities with our planned strategic acquisition of Attivo Networks.
We're adding another growth vector to our platform.
Identity now joins endpoint, cloud, IoT and data.
I couldn't be more excited to introduce everyone to Attivo.
Attivo aligns with the M&A strategy we previously outlined.
First, it expands our addressable market into a $4 billion and growing identity TAM.
And within that, Attivo is capturing share, growing its ARR north of 50%.
Second, user-centric identity protection is highly complementary and value-add for our XDR platform and customers.
It opens new customer and cross-sell opportunities.
Finally, it has a compelling financial profile and strong cultural fit, additive to our hypergrowth and accretive to gross margins.
Identity is a critical component of the enterprise parameter and zero trust framework.
Attivo's market-leading identity offerings help organizations keep passwords safe, admin privileges restricted and user identity intact.
Attivo Networks has the right technology and the team to advance our portfolio and is a natural extension of our Singularity XDR platform and go-to-market strategy.
Misused credentials are now one of the top techniques used in breaches.
If an attacker can compromise the endpoint, they will often look for the next layer of vulnerability, the user's credential.
If successful, attackers can install backdoors, exfiltrate data and change security policies.
Attivo, as part of SentinelOne, will help organizations reduce their attack surface not only at the device level but now at the human identity level, too.
Attivo has a clear product market fit with an established customer and revenue base.
Its differentiated and battle-tested solution is already trusted by over 300 customers from Fortune 500 enterprises to government entities.
Attivo is not just any identity company or technology.
We strongly believe that it's the best and most comprehensive identity security platform in the market today.
Let me briefly introduce you to the three parts of the Attivo platform.
First, identity protection is an agent-based solution that secures credentials and detects malicious identity behaviors.
It delivers real-time protection against credential theft, privilege escalation, lateral movement and more.
Second is identity infrastructure assessment, identity-based vulnerability scanning and management for enterprise infrastructure.
Attivo's scanner provides instant visibility of active directory misconfigurations, suspicious password changes and unauthorized access.
This complements our Ranger network asset visibility and control capabilities and now folds in a user-centric identity view.
Third, identity power deception.
Attivo's deception solution make attackers reveal themselves, their methods and targets through misdirection.
This sums up to a multi-layered approach and a broad set of capabilities to fend off, not just detect, identity-based attacks.
Attivo will put us front and center in the identity security market.
As Dave will discuss later financially, even in the early stages of a joint go-to-market, this acquisition will add to our hypergrowth trajectory.
I'd like to share a few closing thoughts.
There has never been a greater enterprise need for a modern cybersecurity platform, which means a tremendous business opportunity for SentinelOne's world-class autonomous protection.
We are still in the early innings of our innovation and growth.
Our outstanding fourth quarter and fiscal '22 financial performance speak for itself, triple-digit revenue and ARR growth paired with double-digit non-GAAP margin expansion.
We're perfectly positioned for continued success and expansion of our business even in times of global uncertainty.
We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter across every geography, driven by our go-to-market flywheel of sales, marketing, channel and technology partners.
More large enterprises are selecting SentinelOne than ever before because of our industry-leading efficacy, automation, ease of use and differentiated XDR capabilities.
Listening to customers and following many of the largest incidents in cybersecurity over the past few years, identity is a critical vector in delivering the most complete XDR platform.
Not only is it a natural fit within our platform.
It will complement our network of strategic service providers extremely well.
In Q4, we reported impressive ARR growth of 123%, reaching $292 million.
This growth was driven by a healthy mix of new customer additions, renewals and upsells.
Our momentum with large enterprises was particularly strong this quarter.
We added a record number of customers with ARR over $100,000 and a record number of million dollar-plus ARR customers.
All of this is extraordinary and reflects the success of our sales and marketing organizations.
Let me share more on this.
Our customers with ARR over $100,000 grew 137% year over year to 520.
And let me give you an example.
In Q4, we closed the largest new customer deal in our history with one of the most influential and leading global Internet companies.
This win came after an intensive evaluation process, including other next-gen security providers.
I'd like to highlight one additional win, which is emblematic of what we're seeing in the market.
Like most Fortune 500 companies, this enterprise was using multiple operating systems.
They lacked true security parity across all surfaces.
Their existing next-gen EDR vendor failed to quickly deploy and left critical Mac and Linux attack surfaces unprotected.
They terminated their existing three-year subscription mid-flight and turned to SentinelOne.
Singularity XDR deployed instantly across the whole enterprise, which was expedited by our patented Ranger discovery and auto-deploy capabilities.
The customer has become a fantastic partner and is benefiting from our true cross-platform feature parity and automation.
We also closed new deals with many other large enterprises across verticals from technology to global consumer brands to financial services companies.
SentinelOne is winning more market share in every major geography, replacing incumbent vendors of all types and winning against the competition.
In total, at the end of fiscal '22, we secured over 6,700 customers comprising both large enterprises and medium-sized businesses.
That's total growth of more than 70% or almost 3,000 more customers compared to last year.
Our total addressable market is large and expanding.
A majority of the market still utilizes legacy antivirus solutions.
The competitive environment has not changed.
We've maintained incredibly strong win rates in all competitive situations against both legacy and next-gen vendors.
What's more exciting is that the opportunity per customer is much larger today than it was for legacy providers in the past.
This is because of the breadth of our platform, covering endpoints and surfaces of all types, cloud workloads, Kubernetes, mobile devices and IoT devices and soon, identity.
We, once again, achieved strong retention and expansion within our customer base.
Our net retention rate of 129% remained extremely healthy and well above our target of over 120%.
Our NRR was driven by footprint expansion, cross-sell of adjacent modules and upsell from platform tiers.
We continue to prioritize new customer growth, while at the same time, we are seeing massive success in customers consuming more and more of the Singularity platform.
Our modules and DataSet now represent over a third of our new business.
And once again, this is broad-based and includes everything from cloud and Ranger to managed capabilities and DataSet.
Our cloud workload protection and data modules are delivering the highest growth.
They each grew over 10x year over year, reflecting demand for our best-in-class runtime protection for cloud workloads and unparalleled data retention offerings.
I also want to call out our newest endpoint management module, Remote Script Orchestration.
RSO has achieved the fastest ramp of any new module in SentinelOne history.
Our incident response partners love the ability to remotely manage fleets of endpoints at machine speed in critical breach response moments.
Next, I'd like to talk more about our channel partners.
Our partner ecosystem continues to magnify our market presence, significantly extending our reach and efficiency.
Our strategic technology and services partners have grown to over 20% of our business.
This includes MSSPs, MDRs and IR firms.
These partnerships are accretive to our overall growth rate with significant business expansion opportunities yet to be unlocked.
Let me double-click on the success of our IR partnerships.
Over the past year, we focused on partnering with many of the largest and most sophisticated IR providers in the world.
In the fourth quarter, Mandiant selected SentinelOne as a global go-to-market partner.
We are becoming the partner of choice for leading IR providers, including KPMG, Kroll, Arete and many others.
Our strategy brings the best of both worlds to our joint customers, top incident response consultants leveraging the best-in-class XDR platform.
I can't stress enough that we don't compete with our partners.
We work with over 100 of the world's leading IR firms, enabling us to address a majority of the IR market worldwide.
These partnerships create hundreds of high-value and fast-moving opportunities every quarter.
This is significantly more coverage than any single vendor could hope to gain on its own.
We are also very excited about our growing partnerships with MSSPs.
They continue to expand our coverage across large enterprises and mid-market customers.
Leading MSSPs are choosing SentinelOne because of our technology leadership, ease of management and multi-tenancy capabilities.
Today, we are partnering with top-tier MSSPs, including Enable, ConnectWise, Pax8, AT&T and hundreds of others, many of which exclusively work with SentinelOne.
These relationships have helped us achieve significant scale and exposure, complementing our enterprise sales success.
Looking at just a few of our top MSSP partners like Enable and Pax8, they represent millions of endpoints now secured by SentinelOne.
We're extremely confident about the market opportunity we can jointly address with our MSSP partners as more organizations seek managed solutions.
Finally, I'd like to share how we are helping enterprises adopt a zero trust security model by partnering with leading vendors.
Our two-way technology integrations with Zscaler, Mimecast, ServiceNow and many others demonstrate top-tier vendors working together as part of the Singularity ecosystem.
This year has been incredible for SentinelOne, filled with innovation and growth.
And we began the new fiscal year announcing our plan to add identity to our platform, which further expands SentinelOne's capabilities and offers exciting business opportunities.
I'm proud to work with our global team of relentless Sentinels every day.
I'm excited about our future.
We will continue to deliver on our vision by focusing on execution and listening to our customers.
I'll discuss our quarterly financial highlights and provide additional context around our guidance for Q1 and full fiscal year 2023.
I'll also touch on the financial highlights for Attivo and the full year implications.
We delivered another strong quarter of revenue and ARR growth, both well into the triple digits.
We achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 120%, reaching $66 million, and ARR growth of 123%, exceeding $292 million.
We added net new ARR of $56 million in the quarter, a new record for the company.
We saw strong momentum and a robust demand environment for our platform.
The strength of our performance was broad-based, coming from a healthy mix of new customer additions, existing customer renewals and upsells.
All of this was further magnified by the strong underlying seasonality of our fourth quarter.
Our business expanded nicely across all geographies.
Revenue from international markets grew 140% and represented 31% of revenue.
Turning to our cost and margins.
Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 66%, reflecting a double-digit increase of 12% year over year.
We're seeing the benefits from our increasing economies of scale and business expansion, including strong module attach, platform upsell and data processing efficiencies.
This was partially offset by the temporary costs we discussed last quarter associated with the migration of existing customers to our DataSet back end.
We've made excellent progress on this front.
All of our new customers are already using the DataSet back end, plus we've already migrated many of our largest existing customers.
These customers are enjoying up to 10x performance improvements.
We remain on track for our migration plan, and these temporary duplicative costs should be behind us after the first half of this year.
When I put it all together and I look at the Q4 gross margin of 66% and a significant improvement compared to last year, I see increasing evidence of scale and efficiencies of our business.
Looking at the rest of our P&L.
Our non-GAAP operating margin was negative 66%, compared to negative 104% a year ago, a huge improvement of 38 percentage points.
And we achieved these impressive results while investing for growth throughout the year, including the IPO, new product launches and doubling of our workforce.
This progress toward our long-term financial target demonstrates the potential for leverage throughout our business model.
We're investing in our business, which is the right strategy given the huge market opportunity and strong demand for our leading platform.
Moving to our guidance for Q1 and the full fiscal year '23.
In Q1, we expect revenue of $74 million to $75 million, reflecting annual growth of 99% at the midpoint.
For the full year, we expect revenue of $366 million to $370 million, reflecting annual growth of 80% at the midpoint.
While we don't specifically guide for ARR, I do want to remind you that we are a subscription business.
Our ARR and revenue growth track very closely.
Our revenue guidance for Q1 implies that we should be at or better than typical Q1 net new ARR seasonality, which has been down between 25% to 35% sequentially in the past two years.
We believe the structural tailwinds of digital transformation, hybrid work environment and an evolving threat landscape will continue to drive customer adoption of our real-time AI-powered security platform.
The threat landscape is more complex and elevated than ever before, and our product innovation, brand recognition and scaling go-to-market have positioned us well to capture the favorable opportunities.
For Q1, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 63% to 64% and full year non-GAAP gross margin to be between 65% to 67%.
Our Q1 guidance implies over 10 percentage points year-over-year gross margin expansion at the midpoint.
We expect to continue benefiting from increasing scale and better data processing efficiencies.
Our guidance also reflects the migration of our remaining existing customers to DataSet, which, once again, we expect will conclude in the first half of the year.
As a reminder, these costs are temporary.
Based on our full year guidance, we see the opportunity to achieve high 60% gross margins by year-end.
Finally, for non-GAAP operating margin, we expect negative 84% to 86% in Q1 and negative 55% to 60% for the full year.
Both of these represent meaningful year-over-year improvements.
At the midpoint, we expect Q1 operating margin to improve over 40 percentage points and full year operating margin to improve over 25 percentage points.
We see tremendous opportunity for growth, and the investments we're making today will put us in a position to succeed for the long term.
And we're doing this as we make progress toward profitability and our long-term target EBIT margin of 20%-plus.
Before I close, let me share the key financial points related to Attivo.
This should help you as you think through modeling the business for the future.
We're acquiring Attivo for $617 million in a combination of cash and stock plus additional retention.
We expect the deal to close in our fiscal second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.
I want to be clear, Attivo is not currently factored into our fiscal '23 guidance at this time.
We expect to incorporate their financials into our outlook after the deal closes on our next earnings call.
Attivo is an excellent business that can become even stronger as part of our Singularity platform.
They concluded their quarter ended December '21 with over 300 customers and ARR of approximately $30 million, growing north of 50%.
For calendar year '22, the current forecast for the business is to deliver revenue of approximately $40 million for the full year.
And from a margin standpoint, Attivo is accretive to our organic gross margins.
But remember, as we expect this to close during our second fiscal quarter, we would incorporate only a portion of that.
Attivo and SentinelOne are highly complementary solutions that will open up new customer and cross-sell opportunities, further addressing the needs of larger enterprises.
I want to join Tomer, Nick and all of SentinelOne in welcoming the Attivo team.
In summary, Q4 was another excellent quarter with strong execution companywide, and we're expecting that momentum to continue into the next fiscal year.
We can now take questions.
Operator, can you please open up the line?
