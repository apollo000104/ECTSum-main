On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher.
Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties.
Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures.
Anthony will begin with highlights from the third quarter including the progress we are making with our growth strategies and transformation.
Bryan will then take you through a review of the financials before we proceed to Q&A.
This was another solid quarter that finished in line with our expectations, putting us on track to meet the full year 2020 outlook provided on the second-quarter call.
Our company's financial results demonstrate that despite experiencing impacts of COVID-19 and other near-term headwinds, the core fundamentals of our business are strong.
Our continued focus on efficiency is reflected in our improved EBITDA margins and annualized run rate cost savings to date of $225 million which is up $5 million from the second quarter.
We continue to progress toward our revised target of $250 million, and we'll continue to update you on future calls.
Overall, our team continues to make great strides in executing on our strategy, and we are building significant momentum.
So let's start with some of the announcements and successes that occurred during the third quarter.
First is the announcement we made last month that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Bisnode, a longtime Dun & Bradstreet Worldwide Network member.
The acquisition represents a key investment in support of our international growth strategy.
During our October 8 call, we described how Bisnode had several strategic and financial benefits including a significantly expanded footprint across the DACH region which is Germany, Australia and Switzerland, Scandinavia and Central Europe, allowing us to better serve our clients operating in the region and globally.
We are busy with the integration planning in anticipation of the transaction close which is still expected in January 2021 and plan to share incremental financial and strategic details on Bisnode during the next quarter's earnings call.
Now, turning to our sales and operations execution in the third quarter.
Our year-to-date retention rate remained strong at 96%, and 32% of our business was sold in multi-year deals.
One deal that exemplifies both of those metrics is the expansion of our strategic relationship with Microsoft to a multiyear contract for enterprise data management with use cases spanning both finance and risk and sales and marketing.
This is an important example of our ability to not just retain but expand the scope and duration of strategic relationships which is a key element of our growth strategy.
Other third-quarter renewals include a multiyear enterprise license deal with HSBC supporting their data and analytics strategy, a Global 500 office supply retailer who turned to Dun & Bradstreet to help them manage fraud risk and an expanded multiyear relationship with a multibillion-dollar private shipping supplies company.
We also renewed business with insurance solutions provider, T&A, and financial technology solutions provider, WEX, who both use our finance and risk solutions.
Plus, we expanded our relationship with Greensill, a British market-leading provider of working capital finance.
These renewals are examples of where we are able to build off of an existing set of use cases within the enterprise and cross-sell and upsell solutions to broaden our penetration into different parts of their global organizations.
Turning to new business.
Among others, we recently signed a Fortune 500 manufacturer of coatings and paint who turned to our United Kingdom and United States teams for a cross-border solution that provides an end-to-end view of their customers' and suppliers' master data using our latest API, Direct+, offering.
Now we also won back an industry-leading Fortune 1000 global specialty chemicals and performance materials company who turned back to Dun & Bradstreet from a lower-cost alternative to consolidate its credit processes.
As you can see, client engagement is strong, and we continue to see high demand across our existing portfolio of solutions, giving us confidence that we have listened to our clients and that our ongoing transformation of technology, data coverage and analytics is delivering what they need.
In addition to our existing portfolio of solutions, we recently announced a new sales and marketing solution, D&B Connect, a highly configurable plug-and-play, self-service data management platform.
D&B Connect helps our clients assess, clean and enrich their customer data against category-leading data in the Dun & Bradstreet data cloud.
With D&B Connect, time spent on data management is reduced from days to hours so that our clients can focus on what's most important, growing new business.
This is particularly important for small and medium-sized businesses who do not have the resources of a large enterprise and who need to quickly make sense of the data they have and gain additional insights to safeguard and grow their business.
Next, I'll update you on our technology transformation, starting with our progress on Project Ascent.
As we described in the second-quarter call, Project Ascent will modernize our data supply chain, allowing us to rapidly expand our traditional and nontraditional data sets, simplify connectivity to the end user solutions and enhance our overall throughput.
In the quarter, we began investing in global shipping manifest data which is a new nontraditional data set that is complex to curate and in high demand for use in supply chain fraud and risk analytics.
We're already using the data to fulfill a finance and risk use case for our customer engagement and are pleased with the initial performance.
In the fourth quarter and beyond, we plan to enhance the operational user interface, reporting capabilities and most importantly, add new nontraditional data sets and convert our existing data sets over to the new supply chain process.
Our ongoing enhancements to our API technology allow us to expand our latest D&B Direct+ offerings globally including the United Kingdom and Ireland, China and to our Worldwide Network which has been met with strong market reception.
Consolidating and progressing our API solutions enable simplification, scalability and the ability to deliver integrated data solutions with speed at lower cost.
As we connect deeper and deeper within the core workflows of clients through our technology enhancements, it is clear to us that organizations are seeking more effective ways to grow revenue, improve their margins and mitigate their risk.
Our transformation also includes the expansion and enhancement of our data which has led to significant growth of our data cloud which today includes over 400 million public and private businesses worldwide.
This is 85 million or 27% more coverage of our businesses than we had when we took the company private in February of 2019.
We frequently hear from customers who want more and better data coverage, especially in international markets including Asia and Europe.
In February of 2019, we have increased our coverage of businesses in the Asia Pacific region by 57%, fueled by our proprietary AI engine that addresses local language translation.
We also remain focused on the expanding coverage of small and emerging businesses in the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland, increasing the pace of small business data accumulation, growing from 56,000 per month in the first half of the year to 174,000 per month in the third quarter.
We are listening to our clients and delivering which is translating into sales and ultimately, revenue and profit.
Another key element of our transformation is the strengthening of our analytics and insights.
Last quarter, we told you about D&B analytics studio, our cloud-based analytics platform which allows clients to combine their data with third-party data and the scale, diversity and accuracy of our constantly expanding data cloud to achieve broader insights that could not be achieved on their own.
It puts the power of analytics directly in the hands of the user and gives them a glimpse of the power of our data and could translate to future cross-selling into different solutions.
For example, one of the largest global management consulting firms piloted our analytics studio using Dun & Bradstreet data and insights, combined with their data and insights to build derivative B2B analytics for improved customer engagement.
Being able to rapidly ingest third-party internal and customer data is a key advantage for consulting engagements, and we believe that the analytics studio gives our clients differentiated capabilities.
The studio is gaining fast momentum, and we have 13 proof of concepts under way with clients.
We signed five deals in the quarter including a global financial software company who is studying its total addressable market as well as to analyze its customers' product purchasing behaviors.
And with a government client who turned to D&B analytics studio to research and understand the impact of federal funding on small and medium businesses.
With continued strong interest from clients and a growing pipeline, we will continue to evolve the studio with alternative data sources, services and commercial-use solution sets to meet more use cases.
Overall, we are pleased with the extraordinary effort of our team and are excited about the continued progress we are making in our transformation.
We look forward to closing out the year strong.
Today, I will discuss our third-quarter 2020 results and our full year guidance.
Turning to Slide 1.
On a GAAP basis, third-quarter revenues were $442 million, an increase of 8% compared to the prior-year quarter.
This includes the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $38 million.
We had a net loss of $17 million for the third quarter or a diluted loss per share of $0.04 compared to a net loss of $89 million for the prior-year quarter primarily driven by the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, lower transition-related costs, preferred dividends included in the prior-year period and lower interest expense partially offset by the call premium related to the partial redemption of the senior secured notes.
Turning to Slide 2.
I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the third quarter.
Third-quarter adjusted revenues for the total company were $442 million, an increase of 8%.
The increase was driven by the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $38 million.
This increase was partially offset by known headwinds as previously communicated.
These headwinds include lower usage revenues driven by the impact of COVID-19 of approximately $6 million, lower royalty revenues from the wind down of the Data.com partnership of approximately $6 million, a decision we made in the second half of 2019 to make structural changes within the legacy credibility business of $3 million and the shift of a government contract from Q3 to Q4 of $4 million.
The total impact of these known headwinds was approximately $19 million.
Excluding these unique items, revenues grew approximately 3% primarily from growth in our subscription-based revenues in our finance and risk solutions.
Adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $197 million, an increase of 27% primarily driven by the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustments reflected in the corporate segment along with lower overall operating costs driven primarily by lower net personnel expenses due to ongoing cost management initiatives.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.6%.
We had an adjusted net income of $101 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.24.
Turning now to Slide 3.
I will now discuss the results for our two segments, North America and international.
In North America, revenues for the third quarter decreased 3% to $363.3 million.
finance and risk revenues decreased $1.8 million or 1% to $206.6 million.
The decrease was primarily driven by lower usage volumes, the structural change in credibility and the shift of the government contract from Q3 to Q4 partially offset by an $8 million increase in our subscription-based revenues in our risk and government solutions.
Sales and marketing revenues decreased $9.6 million or 6% to $156.7 million.
The decrease was primarily due to lower royalty revenue of approximately $6 million from the Data.com legacy partnership along with lower usage revenues.
Adjusted EBITDA for North America decreased $5.4 million or 3% primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by lower operating costs primarily from ongoing cost management efforts.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for North America was 50.7%.
Turning to Slide 4.
In our international segment, third-quarter revenues increased 10% and or 7% on a constant-currency basis to $79.8 million.
finance and risk revenues increased $8 million to $66.3 million.
Excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange of approximately $1 million, the $7 million increase was driven primarily by Worldwide Network alliances from higher cross-border data sales of approximately $5 million and higher revenue from our U.K. market of approximately $2 million partially offset by lower usage volume in our Asian market of $0.6 million.
Sales and marketing revenues decreased $1.1 million to $13.5 million.
Excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange of $0.4 million, decreased revenue was primarily attributable to lower revenue from our U.K. market of approximately $2 million, lower usage volume in our Asian market of $0.5 million partially offset by increased revenue from Worldwide Network alliances of $0.6 million primarily a result of increased product loyalty.
International adjusted EBITDA of $28.2 million increased $2.7 million or 10.6% primarily due to higher revenues, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the corporate segment increased $44.7 million primarily due to the net impact of lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustments of $38 million.
Turning to Slide 5.
I'll now walk through our capital structure.
At the end of September 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $311.3 million which when combined with the full capacity of our recently upsized $850 million revolving line of credit through 2025 represents total liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion.
On July 6, 2020, we completed the initial public offering and concurrent private placement which raised net proceeds of $2.2 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and IPO-related expenses.
We used the majority of these proceeds to redeem the full amount of preferred stock and 40% or $300 million of our senior unsecured notes.
Shortly after the IPO, we paid down our revolving line of credit balance, and on September 26, we partially redeemed 40% or $280 million of our senior secured notes.
As of September 30, total debt principal was $3,387 million, and our leverage ratio was 4.7 times on a gross basis and 4.2 times on a net basis.
This compared to 5.6 times gross and 5.5 times net at the end of the second quarter.
As a result of our decreased leverage, during the third quarter, our credit rating was upgraded to B+ from B- by S&P Global with a positive outlook, to a B2 from a B3 by Moody's and to a B+ and subsequently to a BB- from a B by Fitch.
We are happy with the progress we are making to deleverage our balance sheet and improve our credit ratings, allowing us more financial flexibility to further support our growth initiatives.
Regarding our recent announcement to acquire Bisnode for approximately SEK 7.2 billion or $818 million, upon close, 75% of the consideration for the equity value will be paid in cash and the remaining 25% will be paid in newly issued shares of common stock of the company in a private placement.
The cash portion will be funded through cash on hand and debt financing.
Once funded, we anticipate that we will maintain net leverage in the range of low to mid four times Turning now to Slide 6.
I'll now walk through our outlook for full year 2020.
Full year guidance is unchanged since our last call.
Revenue on a constant-currency basis is expected to be in the range of $1,729 million to $1,759 million.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $704 million to $724 million.
Revenue and adjusted EBITDA include a negative $21 million impact from deferred revenue purchase accounting in both the low end and high end of the range.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.93.
Adjusted earnings per share includes a negative $0.04 impact from deferred revenue purchase accounting in both the low end and high end of the range.
Additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows.
These estimates include an additional $2 million of public company costs per quarter, with the largest component being corporate insurance.
We expect interest expense of approximately $255 million, reduced from $265 million primarily due to partial paydown of the secured notes, and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $60 million excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting, adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%, weighted average shares outstanding of 367 million and finally, capex of approximately $120 million.
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making in our transformation and the core performance of the business.
Operator, will you please open up the line for Q&A.
