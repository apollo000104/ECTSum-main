We'll begin with a brief strategic overview from Randy, Mike will review the title business, Chris will review F&G, and Tony will finish with a review of the financial highlights.
There is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of this pandemic.
Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results, and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected.
It will also be available through phone replay beginning at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today and through Wednesday, August 11.
We are excited about our second quarter performance as our title business continues to produce record results, and F&G set records for its retail annuity sales, while expanding into new institutional channels, further validating our decision to acquire the company just over one year ago.
We are building a company designed to deliver more stable earnings and cash flow as market conditions change and interest rates eventually rise and pressure our title business, and we can already see the early signs of our success.
Their dedication has allowed us to continue to lead the title industry in revenue, earnings, margins and market share, and produce the best performance in the history of not only the company, but the entire industry.
In the second quarter, we generated record adjusted pre-tax title margins of $688 million compared to $378 million in the year ago quarter and a 22.7% adjusted pre-tax title margin compared with 18.4% in the second quarter of 2020.
Our margin for the quarter matches our record setting margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020 and benefited from our investments in technology, operations and automation over the years as we have worked to improve our efficiency in our title business and maximize our profitability over market cycles.
Turning to F&G, when we closed on our acquisition in June of 2020, we expected F&G to provide a counterbalance to our earnings, which are highly sensitive to mortgage interest rates.
We also believe that our acquisition would accelerate F&G's ratings upgrades and open new channels of distribution to enhance their sales growth.
F&G has far exceeded our expectations as we have gained significant momentum in the bank and broker-dealer channels in the first year of launch, as well as strong sales growth in existing channels.
While delivering record retail sales, we have maintained attractive spreads despite the low interest rate environment that we continue to experience.
F&G has also entered the institutional market with a $750 million funding agreement-backed note issuance, and was just awarded its first pension risk transfer deal over the past week.
F&G ended the second quarter with nearly 320 -- three -- $32 billion in ending assets under management, which is a 20% increase since the acquisition, and it's well on its way toward achieving our goal of doubling assets as sales momentum accelerates.
Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy as we remain committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders, while also focusing on supporting the future growth of our business.
Given our strong earnings and cash flows through the first half of the year, yesterday we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share, an increase of 11% from our previous quarterly dividend and our Board authorized a 3-year share repurchase program of up to 25 million shares.
At the end of 2020, we announced a share buyback plan of $500 million, and during the second quarter, we purchased four million shares for $183 million at an average price of $45.74 per share.
Since announcing the buyback plan, we have purchased 11 million shares for $452 million at an average price of $41.09 per share.
Randy touched upon our record second quarter results as we continued to benefit from low interest rates, driving strong origination demand, the continued rebound in commercial real estate activity and the efforts and focus of our employees in taking care of our customers.
For the second quarter, we generated adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $688 million, an 82% increase over the second quarter of 2020.
Our adjusted pre-tax title margin was 22.7%, a 430 basis point increase over the prior year quarter.
We had a 17% increase in direct orders closed, driven by a 57% increase in daily purchase orders closed and a 65% increase in total commercial orders closed, partially offset by a 5% decrease in daily refinance orders closed.
Total commercial revenue was a record $347 million compared with the year ago quarter of $184 million due to the 65% increase in closed orders and a 14% increase in total commercial fee per file compared with the year ago quarter.
For the second quarter, total orders opened averaged 10,900 per day with April at 10,700, May at 11,200 and June at 10,700.
For July, total orders opened were 11,000 per day as we continue to see strong demand and purchase activity, while the refinance market continues to moderate as compared with last year's robust levels.
Daily purchase orders opened were up 41% in the quarter versus the prior year.
For July, daily purchase orders opened were up 4% versus the prior year.
Refinance orders opened decreased by 25% on a daily basis versus the second quarter of 2020.
For July, daily refinance orders opened were down 32% versus the prior year.
Lastly, total commercial orders opened per day increased by 58% over the second quarter of 2020.
Commercial orders opened per day were at all-time record levels through the second quarter.
For July, total commercial orders opened per day were up 15% over July of 2020.
We remain optimistic that the order volumes we have seen over the last several quarters will drive continued strong commercial performance in the second half of 2021.
As Randy mentioned, our strong results are a clear validation of the investments we have made into technology and how we integrate automation throughout our operations to improve efficiencies and enhance client satisfaction.
We have spoken often about our focus on expense management in real time as open orders rise and fall.
But we also believe that our longer-term focus on integrating automation has significantly improved our performance and profitability through market cycles.
Additionally, we continue to enhance our inHere Experience Platform, which transforms the real estate transaction experience by improving the safety and simplicity needed to start, track, notarize and close a real estate transaction.
During the quarter, we reached an important milestone, as more than one million consumers completed our digital start here opening package, confirming our belief that customers are ready and eager for digital solutions for real estate transactions.
Last week, we announced Notarize inHere, which ensures that the same level of service, security and integrity our customers demand during in-person notarial acts is available when completing their most significant financial transaction online.
We are focused on improving our customers' experience and believe the inHere platform will not only improve client satisfaction, but will also help us to improve our efficiency by reducing the hours spent on a transaction while also positioning FNF to take market share.
As Randy mentioned, one year into our acquisition by FNF, F&G is executing on diversifying our sources of premium, transforming a previously monoline business into a leading provider of solutions in both retail and institutional markets in the life and annuity space.
As we grow, we're focused on generating scale benefits by increasing assets under management, while leveraging Blackstone's unique investment management capabilities to deliver consistent spread.
Additionally, we've made significant investments in our operating platform to become a best-of-breed service provider and allowing us to leverage efficiencies as we scale.
In the second quarter, we had record annuity sales in our retail channel of $1.6 billion, up 80% from the second quarter of 2020 and 9% from the sequential quarter.
We continue to see success with core agent distribution and also with our two newer distribution channels, independent broker-dealers and banks, which generated over $900 million of new premium in the first half of 2021 and are on track to comfortably exceed $1.5 billion for the full year.
In the institutional channel, where we market to institutional clients, we have successfully entered the funding agreement-backed note market and secured our first pension risk transfer transaction over the last week.
Let me provide a few brief details.
In June, F&G issued a $750 million funding agreement-backed note or FABN, at an attractive coupon of 1.75%.
Market reception to our initial FABN issuance was extremely strong, with an order book in excess of $2 billion.
And going forward, we intend to opportunistically execute additional FABN issuances.
Also, we have successfully entered the pension risk transfer market, securing our first deal in late July.
We will assume approximately $65 million in pension liabilities and provide annuity benefits to over 1,200 retirees in a transaction expected to close this month.
In addition, we have a very robust pipeline of deals where we will be bidding on in the third quarter.
Both channels contributed to top line sales results that surpassed our expectations, driven by very strong growth in the retail channels and the launch into two additional institutional channels.
Total sales were $2.7 billion in the second quarter compared to $1.7 billion in the sequential quarter and $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
For the first half of the year, we achieved record sales of $4.3 billion, nearly double the $2.2 billion of total sales in the first half of 2020.
With these strong top line results, average assets under management or AAUM, has surpassed the $30 billion milestone driven by approximately $1.7 billion of net new business flows in the second quarter.
Next, turning to spread, our results continue to be strong.
Total product net investment spread was 295 basis points in the second quarter and FIA net investment spread was 335 basis points.
Investment yield, an important driver of product margin, was above expectation, driven by onetime items in the quarter, primarily favorable investment income on CLO redemptions held at a discount to par.
Adjusting for those notable items though, total product spread was 255 basis points, in line with our historical trend and consistent with our disciplined approach to pricing.
Adjusted net earnings for the second quarter were $92 million.
Strong earnings were driven by record AAUM and strong and consistent spread results as we have maintained disciplined pricing actions on both new business as well as our in-force book.
Net favorable items in the period were $22 million.
Adjusted net earnings, excluding those notable items were $70 million, up from $66 million in the first quarter.
In summary, it's been a defining first half of the year for F&G.
Our profitable growth strategy is firing on all cylinders, and we have successfully diversified our sources of premiums, a key strategic focus.
We remain excited about the opportunity to further contribute to the overall FNF strategy in the years ahead.
We generated $3.9 billion in total revenue in the second quarter, with the title segment producing $3 billion, F&G producing $802 million and the corporate segment generating $56 million.
Second quarter net earnings were $552 million, which includes net recognized gains of $232 million versus net recognized gains of $162 million in the second quarter of 2020.
The net recognized gains and losses in each period are primarily due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of equity and preferred stock securities, whether the securities were disposed of in the quarter or continue to be held in our investment portfolio.
Excluding net recognized gains and losses, our total revenue was $3.6 billion as compared with $2.3 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $592 million or $2.06 per diluted share.
The title segment contributed $526 million, F&G contributed $92 million and the Corporate and Other segment had an adjusted net loss of $26 million.
Including net recognized losses of $30 million, our title segment generated $3 billion in total revenue for the second quarter compared with $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
Direct premiums increased by 57% versus the second quarter of 2020, agency premiums grew by 60% and escrow, title-related and other fees increased by 28% versus the prior year.
Personnel costs increased by 32% and other operating expenses increased by 14%.
All in, the title business generated a 22.7% adjusted pre-tax title margin, representing a 430 basis point increase versus the second quarter of 2020.
Interest and investment income in the title and corporate segments of $27 million, declined $14 million as compared with the prior year quarter due to decreases in dividends received on common and preferred stock, decreases in bond interest and a slight decrease in income from our 1031 exchange business.
FNF debt outstanding was $2.7 billion on June 30 for a debt-to-total capital ratio of 23.2%.
Our title claims paid of $56 million were $41 million lower than our provision of $97 million for the second quarter.
The carried reserve for title claim losses is currently $91 million or 5.8% above the actuary central estimate.
We continue to provide for title claims at 4.5% of total title premiums.
Finally, our title and corporate investment portfolio totaled $6.3 billion at June 30.
Included in the $6.3 billion are fixed maturity and preferred securities of $2.2 billion, with an average duration of 2.9 years and an average rating of A2, equity securities of $1.2 billion, short-term and other investments of $400 million and cash of $2.5 billion.
We ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash and short-term liquid investments at the holding company level.
