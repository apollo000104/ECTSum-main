Leading today's discussion are Vince McMahon, WWE's Chairman and CEO; Nick Khan, WWE's President and Chief Revenue Officer; Stephanie McMahon, WWE's Chief Brand Officer; and Kristina Salen, WWE's Chief Financial Officer.
Their remarks will be followed by a Q&A session.
Actual results may differ materially and undue reliance should not be placed on them.
Additionally, the matters we will be discussing today may include non-GAAP financial measures.
You should note that all comparisons are versus the year-ago quarter, unless otherwise described.
Like every other form of entertainment, we're sports.
We're coming out of COVID.
At first, we were in survival mode, but we found a way.
Once we felt secure, we then saw this as an opportunity too.
We think the way we do business and open what, I call, a WWE treasure chest, the only way to do that the best management team in WWE history.
We have that team, a team that's innovative, drives revenue and as we organize our company in a far more efficient way to take advantage of new revenue streams, new online platforms, new consumer products, new content creation and new opportunities to expand our media rights portfolio on a global basis, I'm always excited about our business.
I don't think I've ever been as excited as I am now.
This is Nick Khan.
It's going to be nice to speak with all of you again.
Since our last earnings call, there have been significant developments in the media industry.
We'd like to discuss them and how the economics of these deals signal to us, a marketplace that continues to put premium on live content.
Additionally, we'd like to outline a number of new revenue streams we've identified in the recent corner -- quarter, excuse me.
I will end by providing an update on our expanding original programing slate, as well as giving you an update on our return to live events and touring.
Recent developments in media have been highlighted by the completion of new content distribution deals.
First, as we discussed last earnings call, Amazon grabbed the Thursday Night NFL package.
So we have no inside knowledge of this, we wouldn't be shocked if Amazon was negotiating now, as we speak, to get that package on its air exclusively early.
In terms of leads, both the NFL and NHL realized substantial increases in the rights fees for their license programs, demonstrating the continuing value of live content.
The NFL saw a media rights increase of 79% even as linear ratings went down a little bit in recent season.
The NHL has already doubled its media rights AAV, having sold just over half of its package.
In the case of the NHL, linear ratings are down about 25%.
In this context, the NHL received tremendous credit for already doubling its AAV from $200 million to $400 million, with another package still available for sale in the marketplace.
Our bet is that part of the package goes to a new suitor.
These deals are indicative of where the media rights marketplace is and where it continues to head.
One of the big takeaways to us, if you look at these packages, is that the overwhelming majority of the media networks are paying to license both the linear rights as well as streaming rights.
The days of splitting those rights appear to be over for the moment.
Look at the NFL, which often sets the standard in media rights negotiations.
Each media partner outside of Amazon paid a multiple of what they were previously paying for the rights to show the games on linear or digital or both.
It's clear to us that these companies view live rights as meaningful subscription and retention programing for their OTT services.
We are confident that our robust marketplace with interested buyers across broadcast cable and OTT positions our rights portfolio for long-term growth.
We had an early case study in WWE delivering audiences for our partners' streaming services a little over two weeks ago, when our premiere event, WrestleMania, was distributed for the first time exclusively on Peacock in the United States.
We were thrilled with the result and our partners at Peacock were even happier.
Stephanie will provide a more thorough update on these achievements from WrestleMania momentarily, but we couldn't be more pleased with the first event.
The promotion from our partners at Fox and NBCU leading into it and the number of conversations we have engaged in subsequent for the Peacock partnership announcement.
And coming off of the subscriber and viewership success of WrestleMania that was delivered to Peacock, we're excited about possibly replicating the licensing of WWE's network to potential streaming partners in key international territories.
It's a story we're sharing with the international community as we introduced WWE Network to potential partners across the globe.
If you look at the success that we're having with our Tencent deal in China, we've seen a 30 times increase in views across all platforms in China, since striking this deal, with 30% of that coming from the viewership on Tencent.
We look at the success we continue to have in India and the United Kingdom, we're excited to replicate that and to grow it further.
Of course, content rights are not our only revenue focus, we're always looking at new streams of revenue.
On April 10, our first day of WrestleMania, we dropped our first NFT, featuring iconic moments from the Undertaker's legendary WWE career.
Many of these sold out in seconds.
We were thrilled with our first foray into this space.
Considering our vast library of wholly owned intellectual property, look for more NFTs from us in the near future.
In this quarter, we also made a key deal in the gambling space.
Stephanie is going to provide background on that deal later as well.
As we continue to expand WWE's brand beyond the ring, we remain focused on developing the slate of original programing from our WWE Studio.
We've sold a multi-episode animated series to Crunchyroll, which, as all of you know, is now owned by Sony, Young rock, which we've talked about previously, chronicles the real life journey of Dwayne Johnson from childhood to WWE legend and beyond.
They debuted on NBC and it's doing significant business on NBC and with rears on USA and Peacock.
And last Sunday, the Stone Cold Steve Austin documentary was the highest-rated biography in 16 years on A&E.
Our other show on A&E that night, WWE's Most Wanted Treasures retained 79% of that lead end audience.
There are seven more biographies featuring our superstars each Sunday for the next seven weeks.
Again, all of these projects from sitcoms to unscripted to documentary to animate are produced or co-produced by us via our Studio.
Last, as I mentioned earlier, stay tuned for our announcement showcasing our full-time return to live event touring.
This year's WrestleMania was historic for many reasons, attracting more than 50,000 fans, representing full capacity for the two-night event.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention how amazing it felt to have the opportunity to stand on the stage, look out at the faces in the audience and hear their cheers.
From the superstars next to me to the people in the crowd to even maybe my father Vince McMahon, there wasn't a dry eye as we all celebrated something much bigger than ourselves, the power of the lion.
Last year's WrestleMania with no fans at our performance centers went back to Raymond James Stadium with a full circle moment, providing a sense of hope for the future and where our signature then, now, forever became then, now, forever together.
It is because of this powerful fan base, what we call the WWE Universe that we were able to achieve record-breaking performances across all of our platforms, including reaching new audiences through our domestic streaming partner, NBCU's Peacock.
And a world went 52 days, we successfully launched our partnership with Peacock with cross-functional task forces responsible for assimilating meta data, transporting and formatting our most viewed content and creating marketing direct to consumer campaigns and one of the most comprehensive publicity plans we have ever had for WrestleMania.
One executive at Peacock described our process as a best-in-class example for how partnerships should work.
The results with the most viewed live events in Peacock's young history.
The launch was supported by two integrated media campaigns executed across the Comcast, NBCU, Peacock and WWE portfolio.
WrestleMania media coverage increased 25% with over 500 individual new stories, representing 1.2 billion media impressions.
Creatively, everything kicked off the Friday before with the WrestleMania addition of SmackDown on FOX, where Jey Uso won the esteemed Andre the Giant Battle Royal.
Sasha Banks and Bianca Belair became the first African-American female superstars to main event WrestleMania.
Pop star, Bebe Rexha, saying the national anthem and hip-hop star, Wale, rapped Big E down to the ring.
Grammy award winning artist Bad Bunny and YouTube influencer Logan Paul found themselves getting in on the action inside the ring.
Bad Bunny's performance received praise from ESPN, counting it as one of, if not, the most impressive showings by a celebrity in the ring.
And apparently, a lot of people enjoyed seeing YouTube influencer Logan Paul gets stunned as he trended number two on Twitter and generated nearly 100 million impressions on social media alone.
WWE also secured a record 14 new and returning blue chip partners for WrestleMania, including Snickers as the presenting partner for the sixth consecutive year and presenting partner of the main event.
Papa John's Cricket Wireless, P&G's Old Spice, Credit One Bank and DraftKings.
DraftKings is now an official gaming partner of WWE, focusing on their signature free-to-play pools, which included placing some fun bets on main event matches in both nights of WrestleMania.
Video views during WrestleMania week across digital and social platforms, including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, hit 1.1 billion and 32 million hours of content were consumed, representing a 14% and 9% increase, respectively.
WWE related content saw 115 million engagements and WrestleMania was also the world's most social program, both nights of the weekend, delivering 71 Twitter trends.
As Nick mentioned, for the first time, we launched a series of NFTs, featuring the Undertaker at record-breaking WrestleMania weekend e-commerce sales and record merchandise per capita sales in stadiums.
We also held more than 10 community activations throughout the week, including collaborating with the Mayor's Office to customize our vaccination messaging for the local market, recognizing local community champions, teaming with FOX Sports to donate equipment to Special Olympics, Florida, and working with various organizations, including Feeding Tampa Bay to combat food and nutrition and security.
On USA Network, the following Night Raw delivered its best performance in the 18 to 49 demo in over a year and NXT's debut on its New Night on Tuesday was up 29% in the 18 to 49 demo year-over-year.
As we move toward our next streaming special, WrestleMania Backlash on Sunday, May 16, we are excited to build on our recent success, grow our audience through Peacock's enhanced reach, align with Iconic franchises, such as the Olympics and the Super Bowl and continue to leverage Peacock sales and promotional teams.
Additionally, key brand metrics in the first quarter are as follows.
TV viewership continued to remain stable, maintaining a trend that began when we transitioned out of the performance center and invested in WWE ThunderDome at the end of August.
From that time to the end of this quarter, Raw ratings have held steady and SmackDown ratings increased 9%.
Notably, all Raw appearances featuring Bad Bunny showed an increase of 31% in the Hispanic persons 18 to 34 demo.
And Bad Bunny's total social impressions during the time of his story lines equaled nearly 700 million.
Digital consumption increased 7% to 367 million hours.
WWE's flagship YouTube channel crossed 75 million subscribers and is now the fourth most viewed YouTube channel in the world.
WWE sales and sponsorship revenue increased 19%, excluding the loss of a large scale international event.
As I mentioned on our last call, brands are looking for unique ways to reach their consumers.
WWE is perfectly positioned to do just that with the ability to create customized content experiences and utilize WWE superstars that resonate with target audiences.
For example, the creation of our digital content series, Grit & Glory, for GM's Chevy Silverado brand and the creation of a new superstar, the Night Panther and a first-ever campaign integration across multiple platforms to market the new scent from Old Spice.
In our view, WWE is well positioned to continue to elevate our brand, grow our business and engage new and existing consumers across all media platforms.
As Vince, Nick and Stephanie highlighted, transitioning WWE Network to Peacock, while launching WrestleMania with a live audience of 50,000 fans in attendance is a major accomplishment.
I would add by the flexibility, speed and sheer brute force of will demonstrated by the WWE team, the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit on display was as strong as I've seen in my 25-plus years prior in the tech industry.
Today, I'll discuss WWE's financial performance, which underscores that spirit.
As a reminder, all comparisons are versus the year ago quarter, unless I say otherwise.
In the first quarter, WWE continued to manage a challenging environment.
Total WWE revenue was $263.5 million, a decline of 9% due to the cancellation of live events, including a large scale international event and the associated loss of merchandise sales, all due to COVID-19.
Despite this decline, adjusted OIBDA grew 9% to $83.9 million, reflecting the upfront recognition related to WWE's licensing agreement and the decline in operating expenses that resulted from the absence of live events.
Looking at the WWE media segment, adjusted OIBDA was $107 million, growing 4% as increased revenue and profit from WWE's licensing agreement with Peacock, as well as increased revenue from the escalation of domestic core content rights fees more than offset the absence of a large scale international event.
During the quarter, we continue to produce Raw and SmackDown in our state-of-the-art environment, WWE ThunderDome, at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Our operating results continue to be impacted by the year-over-year increase in production costs associated with bringing nearly 1,000 live virtual fans into our show, surrounded by pyrotechnics, laser displays and drone cameras, we did achieve some efficiency quarter-over-quarter.
With the April transition of WWE ThunderDome to Yuengling Center in Tampa Bay, we expect this investment will continue through at least the second quarter as it elevates the level of excitement and brings our fans back into the show.
Despite a challenging environment, WWE continues to produce a significant amount of content, nearly 650 hours in the quarter across television streaming and social platforms.
And as Nick described, we continue to develop our slate of original programing from our WWE Studios.
Live events adjusted OIBDA was a loss of $4.3 million due to a 97% decline in live event revenue.
These declines were due to the loss of ticket revenue, resulting from the cancellation of events.
As we've said, we are delighted to have entertained ticketed fans and an audience of over 50,000 at WrestleMania a few weeks ago.
We look forward to the highly anticipated return of regular ticketed events.
However, predicting the pace of that return is challenging and as of this moment, we do not anticipate staging such events until at least the second half of 2021.
WWE also continues to introduce new products, leveraging a superstar talent brand and strong distribution partners.
As examples of WWE's continuing commitment to product innovation, WWE released three new championship title belts and a suite of branded products to commemorate Stone Cold Steve Austin's 25 years at WWE.
Also in the quarter, WWE continue to be the number one action figure sold at Walmart, where it continues to deliver exclusive products.
In the first quarter, WWE generated approximately $54 million in free cash flow, which was down slightly.
Improved operating performance and lower capital expenditures were offset by the timing of collections associated with network revenue.
Notably, during the first quarter, we returned approximately $84 million of capital to shareholders, including $75 million in share repurchases and $9 million in dividends paid.
To date, more than $158 million of stock has been repurchased, representing approximately 32% of the authorization under our $500 million repurchase program.
As of March 31, 2021, WWE held approximately $461 million in cash and short-term investments, which reflected the repayment of the remaining $100 million borrowed under WWE's revolving credit facility.
Accordingly, WWE estimates debt capacity under the revolving line of credit of $200 million.
And finally, a word on WWE's business outlook.
Last quarter, WWE issued guidance for 2021 adjusted OIBDA of $270 million to $305 million.
This range of guidance reflects estimated revenue growth, driven by the impact of the Peacock transaction, the gradual ramp up of ticketed live events and large scale international events and the escalation of core content rights fees, offset by increased personnel and television production expenses.
The company is not changing full-year guidance at this time.
The guidance range is subject to risk over the remainder of the year, particularly related to the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions on the company's ability to stage live events, including large scale international events.
Turning to WWE's capital expenditures, as we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate increased spending on the company's new headquarters, as we restart this project in the second half of 2021.
For 2021, we've estimated total capital expenditures of $65 million to $85 million to begin construction, as well as to enhance WWE's technology infrastructure.
We're in the process of reevaluating the headquarter project and will provide further guidance on future capital expenditures when that work is completed.
For the second quarter of 2021, we estimate adjusted OIBDA will decline as incremental profits from Peacock and the escalation of content rights fees are more than offset by increased production, personnel and other operating costs.
As a reminder, the year-over-year rise in television production costs reflects the impact of our investment in WWE ThunderDome relative to the lower cost of producing content from our training facility, as we did exclusively in the second quarter of last year.
As the timing and rate of returning ticketed audiences to WWE's live events remain subject to uncertainties, we are not reinstating more specific quarterly guidance at this time.
In the first quarter, WWE generated solid financial results as we executed on key strategic objectives.
As Vince, Nick and Stephanie mentioned, we believe we can continue to innovate, enhancing our fan engagement, driving the value of our content and developing new products and markets, as well as cultivating new partnerships.
We look forward to sharing our progress on these initiatives with you all.
That concludes our remarks, and I will turn it now back to Michael.
