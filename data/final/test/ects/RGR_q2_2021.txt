Then Tom Dineen, our Chief Financial Officer, will give an overview of the second quarter 2021 financial results, and then I will discuss our operations and the state of the market.
Copies of these documents may be obtained by contacting the company or the SEC or on the company website at ruger.com/corporate or the SEC website at sec.gov.
We do reference non-GAAP EBITDA.
Please note that the reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP EBITDA can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2021, both of which are posted on our website in the Investor Relations section.
Now Tom will discuss the company's second quarter 2021 results.
For the second quarter of 2021, net sales were $200.1 million and diluted earnings were $2.50 per share.
For the comparable prior year period, net sales were $130.3 million and diluted earnings were $1.05 per share.
For the first six months of 2021, net sales were $384.4 million and diluted earnings were $4.66 per share.
For the corresponding period in 2020, net sales were $253.9 million and diluted earnings were $1.91 per share.
The substantial increase in profitability for the second quarter was attributable to the increase in sales and production, resulting in favorable leveraging of fixed costs including depreciation, engineering and other indirect labor expenses, a significant reduction in sales promotional activities and improved labor efficiencies.
Not surprisingly, our strong financial results yielded robust cash generation.
During the first half of 2021, we generated $76.2 million of cash from operations.
We reinvested $11.5 million of that back into the company in the form of capital expenditures.
We estimate that 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately $20 million predominantly related to new product development.
Our ability to shift manufacturing equipment between cells and between facilities improves overall utilization and allows for reduced capital investment.
Our balance sheet at July 3, 2021, remains rock solid.
Our cash and short-term investments, which are invested in UST bills, totaled $173.6 million.
Our current ratio was 3.7:1, and we had no debt.
Our stockholders' equity was $319.1 million, which equates to a book value of $18.14 per share, of which $9.86 per share was cash and short-term investments.
Our shareholders continue to share in our success in a direct and timely manner.
In the first month -- in the first six months of 2021, we returned $27.6 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends.
Our Board of Directors declared a $1 per share quarterly dividend for shareholders of record as of August 16, 2021, payable on August 27, 2021.
Upon receiving the $1 quarterly dividend, shareholders will have received over $2.50 of dividends per share thus far in 2021.
As a reminder, our quarterly dividend is approximately 40% of net income and, therefore, varies quarter-to-quarter.
That's the financial update for the second quarter.
The second quarter of 2021 marked the seventh consecutive quarter of meaningful growth in sales, profitability and virtually every financial and operating metric despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Demand for our products has remained strong.
The estimated unit sell-through of the company's products from the independent distributors to retailers increased 13% in the first half of '21 compared to the prior year period.
For the same period, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System background checks, as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, commonly referred to as NICS checks, decreased 5%.
The increase in the sell-through of the company's products compared favorably to the decrease in adjusted NICS background checks and may be attributable to the following: strong consumer demand for Ruger products, increases in production for each of the past seven quarters and the introduction of new products that have been met with strong consumer demand.
New product development remains among our highest priorities.
On the heels of the successful MAX-9 pistol launch earlier this year, we introduced the Ruger LCP MAX, a 380 Auto pistol in June.
This is the latest offering from the Ruger LCP family, which has set the standard for personal protection pistols for over a decade.
The LCP MAX joins an impressive roster of products that were introduced in the past two years.
These include the extremely popular Ruger-57 Pistol, which is awarded the 2020 Caliber Award for best overall new product by the Professional Outdoor Media Association in conjunction with the NASGW.
The LCP II in.
22 Long rifle, which is based on the venerable LCP platforms and utilizes our Lite Rack system for easier slide manipulation and reduced recoil.
The Wrangler revolver, our latest take on the classic single-action revolver, which shows no signs of slowing down and the MAX-9 pistol, a versatile 9-millimeter pistol that has been met with tremendous excitement.
In the first half of 2021, new product sales represented $78 million or 22% of firearm sales compared to $48 million or 21% of firearm sales in the first half of 2020.
As a reminder, derivatives and product line extensions of mature product families are not included in our product sales -- new product sales calculation.
Nonetheless, they are valuable additions to the Ruger catalog of products and are greatly appreciated by distributors, retailers and our loyal Ruger consumers.
We look forward to the return of Marlin lever action rifles, which we plan to begin shipping in the fourth quarter.
If you're interested in following our progress with the Marlin product line, check out Marlin firearms on Facebook or Instagram.
We have been delighted with the overwhelming interest and support that we have received from Marlin fans.
Since March of 2020, our workforce has been strengthened by approximately 400 folks, an increase of 25%, and our quarterly unit production has increased by over 200,000 units or 58%.
This outsized growth in production is indicative of our labor efficiency gains.
And despite the growth in our output at the end of the second quarter of 2021, our finished goods inventory and distributor inventories of Ruger products were 160,000 units lower than they were at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
The last time these inventories were at what we would consider normal or expected pre-COVID-19 levels.
Since the onset of COVID-19 in March of 2020, we remain proactive in maintaining the health and safety of our employees and mitigating its impact on our business, by providing all hourly employees with an additional two weeks of paid time off in 2020 and an additional week in 2021, providing cash and other incentives for employees to become fully vaccinated, holding multiple on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics at our manufacturing facilities, reducing hiring in early 2020 to help maintain the health and safety of employees and the cleanliness of our facilities, encouraging employees to continue to work remotely wherever possible and maintaining social distancing throughout each manufacturing facility, including in every manufacturing cell, confidentially communicating with and assisting employees with potential health issues through our dedicated facility nurses, restricting visitor access to minimize the introduction of new people to the factory environment, implementing additional cleaning, sanitizing and improved ventilation and other health and safety processes to maintain a clean and safe workplace, providing all employees with multiple face mask coverings and other personal protective equipment and currently mandating their use by unvaccinated and at-risk individuals at all times in our facilities and issuing periodic guidance and reminders to all associates to encourage them to engage in safe and responsible behaviors.
With the United States once again seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases and positivity rates, we remain vigilant and are proactively adjusting our plan accordingly to keep our associates healthy and safe and to minimize any disruption to our business.
We estimate that COVID-related costs will total approximately $1.5 million in 2021.
Included in this estimate is a $200 bonus for every employee who becomes fully vaccinated.
Our financial strength, evidenced by our debt-free balance sheet provides financial security and flexibility as we manage through challenges like COVID-19 and remain focused on the long-term goals and creation of shareholder value.
Those were the highlights of the second quarter of 2021.
Operator, may we have the first question?
