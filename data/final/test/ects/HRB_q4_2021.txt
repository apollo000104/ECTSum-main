During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up, after which they may choose to jump back into the queue.
Today I'm excited to share our outstanding results.
I'm proud of what our team has accomplished, including progress on our Block Horizons strategy and a very strong tax season.
Our results show that our multi-year efforts to improve client trajectory are gaining traction.
We grew clients and achieved our largest overall and the largest assisted market share gains in over a decade.
We drove significant growth in DIY revenue and continued strong growth at Wave.
We increased the digitization of the business, advanced how we serve small businesses at Block Advisors and made meaningful progress in building our new mobile banking product.
Today, we also announced another increase in our quarterly dividend.
Our fifth in the past six years, further demonstrating the confidence we have in both our financial strength and outlook for continued long-term growth.
With that backdrop, let me provide more detail on what we've achieved with Block Horizons since our Investor Day in December, followed by additional color on the 2021 tax season Tony will then review our full-year financials and capital structure, discuss our fiscal year change, and provide thoughts on our fiscal year '22 outlook.
Since our Investor Day in December where we laid out our Block Horizons strategy, we've had our foot on the gas to execute across our three strategic imperatives: small business; financial products; and Block Experience.
Small business and financial products are categories where we have a right to compete and advantages to help us win.
Block Experience represents our modernized approach to tax.
I'll start with an update on each of these key areas.
In small business, we've gained traction on all elements of our strategy.
First, we expanded our reach to more small business owners by improving our client experience in tax and amplifying our messaging.
In a few short months, we certified over 25,000 tax professionals to serve small businesses, relaunched the Block Advisors brand, and built a new Block Advisors product in DIY, which includes unlimited expert help.
Our Block Advisors marketing campaign, which launched in mid-February, resonated with customers as it drove awareness of our ability to serve small business owners' unique needs and reinforced our expertise as a trusted year-round partner for this critical customer segment.
Second, we made progress in bookkeeping and payroll services, laying the foundation for future growth.
And third, Wave continued exceptional growth of over 35% for the year, while also expanding Wave Money as the center of the experience.
Turning to financial products, we've begun our journey to provide additional value to underbanked customers by offering a mobile banking alternative to meet their unique needs.
We've completed the design phase and are now building the beta version of our product, which we expect to launch by calendar year-end.
Regarding Block Experience, we're continuing to infuse human help into our DIY offering and transform the assisted experience through digital tools as we meet our customers however and wherever they wish to be served.
We're already seeing positive signs in virtual adoption by our assisted customers and we also saw a great uptake of DIY clients requesting human help.
I'll share more on this in a moment as I go through tax season details.
The theme of this year's tax season for H&R Block can be summed up in one word: growth.
To provide context on the strength of our results this year, I'd like to first frame the industry dynamics, particularly given this year's unique considerations.
This season included a delayed start from the IRS, a two additional rounds of related stimulus payments, mid-season changes to tax laws, added new policies regarding unemployment and recovery rebate credits, and finally, a one-month delay in the filing deadline to May 17, all in year two of the pandemic.
The industry in total saw an increase in filings when compared to last year's completed season, that is to the filing deadlines in each year.
There was also a mix shift from DIY to assisted, representing a reversal of prior-year trends.
As a reminder, the category also showed strength in 2020 as assisted returns were essentially flat in a year when the operating environment was far from normal.
The resilience and sustainability of the assisted category, even amid the pandemic reflects our conviction and its stability over time.
The bottom line continues to be that most Americans want personal help with their taxes and nobody is better-positioned than we are in delivering that expert help.
With the industry backdrop as an important context, I'd like to provide more detail on our results.
To clarify, when making comparisons, I will discuss the full tax season in 2021 versus the full tax season in 2020, despite the different filing deadlines.
Later, Tony will share more about our fiscal-year results and how these were impacted by the extension.
We saw growth in overall clients, total share, assisted share, and strong revenue performance in DIY.
We estimate that we gained approximately 30 basis points of total market share when compared to last year's completed tax season.
This is our best result in over a decade.
In our assisted business, we grew clients by over 700,000 or approximately 7%, in estimate, we gained 70 basis points of market share.
Again, the best in over 10 years.
Based on these results and the continued positive feedback we hear from customers, we know that our work to improve value, quality, and digital capabilities are helping consumers rediscover a new H&R Block.
We were the go-to source of help for many individuals who haven't normally been filing, but who this year had questions about unemployment or receiving the recovery rebate credit.
Though some of these filings may be one-time in nature, we're committed to doing all we can to retain these additional clients.
Importantly, our client satisfaction scores remained strong and our new client scores improved with high marks for being cared for, price for service, and intent to return.
With these dynamics, we held pricing flat in assisted.
Our net average charge was down about 2% due entirely to mix as the majority of growth in new clients came from filers at lower price points.
While these new clients caused a decrease in our average charge, they were additive to revenue.
Our share gains show that our value is being recognized in the marketplace, giving us confidence to consider modest price increases.
Moving to our DIY business, revenue grew nearly 20% due to an increase in the net average charge related to improved mix and pricing actions.
Also, significantly more clients chose to add human help, resulting in the second year in a row of tax pro review growing more than 50%.
We saw a slight share loss as we focused on more valuable returns, evidenced by our improved mix and an increase in NAC of over 20%.
The increasing use of human help by our DIY customers, along with the use of digital tools by our assisted customers demonstrates the importance of our Block Experience efforts to blend digital capabilities with human expertise and care.
We're confident we're on the right path to serving consumers in a modern way.
As a reminder, digital does not mean DIY and the increasing use of digital capabilities in the assisted business does not reduce our NAC.
I'll now move on to small business, which includes our Block Advisors and Wave brands.
We grew assisted small business filers by 4%.
And as I previously shared, Wave continues to produce strong results as we see increases in customers new to the brand, overall payments volume, and the use of payroll services.
This all led to revenue growth of over 35%.
In addition, our strategy of putting Wave Money at the core of our offering is picking up steam as Wave Money deposits have grown at a pace of 40% per month for the past six months.
In summary, our team provided help and inspired confidence for millions of consumers and small business owners this season.
We made tremendous progress in our first year of Block Horizons, running technology and digital tools with human expertise in tax to help achieve our largest market share gains in over a decade.
We improved our offerings in small business, drove significant growth of Wave, and are making progress on our new mobile banking platform.
We are confident about the journey we're on and I'm very excited about our future.
Today, I'll provide color on our full fiscal-year results, discuss the impact of the filing extension beyond our fiscal year, recap our dividend and capital allocation strategy, provide details on our new line of credit, and share more about our fiscal year-end change.
I'll also provide some more context about our baseline earnings and our outlook for fiscal '22.
The extension of the U.S. federal tax filing deadline to May 17 led to the tax season concluding beyond fiscal '21, causing a timing difference in our financial results.
If we were able to include these amounts in our fiscal 2021 results, we would have significantly surpassed the high end of our previous outlook for both revenue and earnings.
tax return volumes due to the extension of last tax season into fiscal '21.
We also achieved improved monetization within DIY and increase in Emerald Card revenues related to federal stimulus payments, and strong growth from Wave.
Regarding expenses, due to strong fiscal management, we outperformed our savings target while still investing appropriately in our Block Horizons strategic imperatives.
Total operating expenses were $2.6 billion, which increased by $82 million or 3% due to an increase in variable labor, which is partially offset by prior-year impairment charges, lower bank partner fees, and travel-related costs.
Interest expense increased $11 million, which reflects the precautionary draw on our line of credit at the end of last fiscal year, partially offset by a lower interest rate on our debt issuance earlier in the fiscal year.
As a result, pre-tax income was $669 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $3 million in the prior year.
Our effective tax rate was just 12%, driven by favorable tax planning we implemented during the year.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.03 to $3.11, while adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.84 to $3.39.
Regarding discontinued operations, there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter.
Moving to capital allocation, our strategy demonstrates current strength and confidence in our future, supported by strong free cash flow.
Our priorities remain unchanged: first, maintain adequate liquidity; next, invest in our business; and then support the dividend and opportunistically repurchase shares.
Due to the health of our business and our outlook, we announced today an increase in our quarterly dividend of 4% to $0.27 per share.
This marks the fifth time we've raised the dividend in six years, resulting in a 35% total increase over that time.
Regarding share repurchases, we bought a total of $38 million in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we repurchased $108 million at an average price of $16.29, allowing us to retire 11.6 million shares or 6% of our float.
Approximately $564 million remains under our share repurchase authorization, which expires in June of 2022.
I'm also pleased to announce that we just amended our line of credit to a new five-year facility.
We lowered the capacity to $1.5 billion, which is more appropriate for our business needs and result in lower costs.
We were able to renew at favorable rates and reduce our expected run-rate costs by approximately $3 million per year.
Finally, we aligned our covenants to our new fiscal calendar, which I'll share more about in a moment.
This is yet another sign of our financial strength, which provides a solid foundation for growth.
Switching gears, I'd like to talk about our decision to change the fiscal year.
Given the lack of comparability in our results over the past couple of years due to tax season extensions, we felt it was appropriate to examine our fiscal year-end.
After this review, we have made the decision to move from an April year-end to a junior -- June year-end effective immediately.
The change allows for better alignment of complete tax seasons in comparable fiscal periods and other related benefits.
We plan to file a report on Form 10-QT for the transition month of May and June later this summer.
Fiscal 2022 will begin on July 1 and end on June 30, 2022, with our first-quarter results through September 30 reported in early November.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our outlook for fiscal '22 based on our new June year-end.
Before doing so, we know investors are seeking to better understand baseline results and thought it would be helpful to provide additional context for fiscal '21, including the change to the fiscal year.
To reset to the new fiscal year, we take our current fiscal year '21 results and remove May and June from 2020 at the beginning of the year, and then add May and June from 2021.
We then normalize the fiscal '21 for two things.
First, given tax season 2020 concluded on July 15, we are backing out the activity related to tax season that carried into the new fiscal '21.
Second, we remove one-time impacts related to the pandemic.
These primarily consisted of incremental Emerald Card revenue related to stimulus payment loads and one-time expenses for associated benefits and supplies, both related to the pandemic.
This normalized view of fiscal '21 ending June 30 would result in an estimated revenue of $3.25 billion and EBITDA of $760 million.
Turning now to fiscal '22, we considered a number of variables both for the tax industry and for us.
These include the potential industry loss of one-time filers who were motivated to file this tax -- past tax season for the recovery rebate credit, changes in unemployment-related benefits, and the expansion of the child tax credit.
After considering these impacts, we expect industry volumes to be flat to slightly down in '22 and anticipate a similar trend for our volume.
As such, we now expect fiscal '22 revenue to be in the range of $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion.
EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $765 million to $815 million.
Both of these are an improvement to the normalized fiscal year '21 results I shared with EBITDA growing faster than revenue.
Regarding our outlook, the effective tax rate is anticipated to be between 16% and 18%, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to be between $150 million and 160 million, and interest expense is anticipated to be between $90 million and $100 million.
Our projected results demonstrate solid growth despite comparing against very strong performance last year and are a sign that we have the right strategy under way.
In summary, I am very pleased with both our tremendous performance this season and the trends we are seeing in the business.
We are committed to our financial principles and are on a path to long-term sustainable growth.
Before we begin Q&A.
I also want to reiterate how pleased I am about this year's results and the progress we've made, as well as our confidence in the Block Horizons strategy going forward.
The last two years have been incredibly complex and disruptive, and this success is made possible by our hardworking associates, franchisees, and tax pros, who once again demonstrated how H&R Block inspires confidence in our clients and communities.
As we open the line for Q&A, I want to make a note of transition in our Investor Relations role.
Colby Brown has been leading these efforts for more than eight years and has done a tremendous job.
We recognize the importance of supporting our investment community.
And as Colby transitions out of the IR role, we have brought on Michaella Gallina, whose sole focus will be serving analysts and investors.
Michaella has led IR at a number of companies and was also an analyst on the buy side.
