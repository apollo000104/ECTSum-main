If you have technical questions on the quarter, please pick them up with the IR team in the days, in the weeks that follow.
GAAP reconciliations for any non-U.S. GAAP measures are included in our news release or otherwise available on our website.
And also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.
So with that, over to you Gavin.
Let me start by stating the obvious, the first quarter was not the quarter we expected to have, that reality was driven by 3 events, cyber security incident that caused the global system outage, a freak winter storm in Texas, that forced utility companies to shutoff power to major businesses, including our Fort Worth brewery and government pandemic restrictions that shut down the entire on-premise channel in the UK and severely restricted much of the on-premise in Canada.
To say that all of these events happened in a single quarter is unprecedented, would be an understatement.
So while we can't control the weather, across the business, we executed well on what was in our control.
That's true, how we responded to each event.
Our team quickly implemented contingency plans to boost production and get our core brands back to a stable inventory before Memorial Day.
Right now, we are shipping, over 1 million barrels a week in the United States for the first time in nearly a year.
But most importantly, it's true of how we are executing on our revitalization plan.
During the first quarter, Coors Light and Miller Lite outperformed the combination of Bud Light and Michelob Ultra in U.S. industry share performance versus the prior year according to IRR.
Our U.S. above premium portfolio grew brand volumes versus the prior year and continue to gain industry share according to IRR, and we took substantial steps toward our hard seltzer ambition.
Our Truss joint venture's non-alcoholic cannabis beverages are holding strong as the number 1 dollar share spots in the entire Canadian cannabis beverage market.
As expected, the availability of our 12-ounce standard cans returned to normal levels.
And we continued working to protect the environment through significant initiatives in the United Kingdom.
So let's look deeper in each area.
Let's start with our Coor.
We will continue to see improving brand volume trends for Coors Light and Miller Lite in North America over the past quarter, dovetailing off strong performance in 2020.
But the performance is even more impressive when you look at our biggest brand and our biggest family of brand.
Coors Light finished the quarter with its strongest category share performance since Q1 of 2017.
And Coors Banquet posted its best quarterly volume performance in over 4 years in the United States.
We're building on that strong performance in the Coors family of brands with the launch of Coors Pure in March, our first USDA certified organic beer brand.
And we had a strong Q1 in Panama, with over a 50% increase in brand volumes with Coors Light's explosive triple-digit growth leading the way.
Now, when it comes to our plans to aggressively grow our above-premium portfolio, as you know, we have big ambitions for hard seltzers is this year and the first quarter was a big one.
And as we sit here today, our share of U.S. hard seltzer segment is over 50% higher than it was at the beginning of the year.
In a single week, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer jumped to 3.2 share U.S. hard seltzer category, despite only launching in 16 markets.
And it achieved a 20 share in Texas.
Now I know it's early days, but there is a stunning effect, which speaks to the opportunity with this brand.
And it's not alone in our portfolio, Vizzy was IRR top 10 U.S. industry growth brand in Q1.
We are building on that with the brand's second variety pack, which launched in March and the new Vizzy Lemonade which launched several weeks later.
They are both performing well.
And in fact, Vizzy Lemonade is the second fastest turning hard lemonade seltzer in the market.
We made significant headway with our hard seltzers in Canada and in Europe as well.
Of just over a month in market, Vizzy and Coors seltzers are top hard seltzer brands with some of the leading Canadian retailers.
In the UK, our new Three Fold hard seltzer brand is launched.
While our new brand Wai in Central and Eastern Europe is launching in the coming weeks.
In above premium beers, Blue Moon Light Sky, the number 1 new item in U.S. beer last year is currently the number 1 share gainer in U.S. craft beer in 2021.
And Hop Valley has made its official national debut in the U.S. and Canada.
So our first national light here in the U.S., we believe it will be another driver of growth for our above premium portfolio.
When it comes to our plans to expand beyond beer, last year we made a lot of news as we took on a number of partnerships to build a competitive portfolio.
This year, it's all about executing on those plans.
Though it gives us a strong entry into the $16 billion U.S. energy and performance space and is positioned to take a meaningful share of the category within a matter of months, it's just now beginning to hit shelf.
For Bar Memorial Day we expect we will have over 80,000 points of distribution.
And by the end of summer, that number is expected to climb to nearly 150,000.
La Colombe gives us the number 1 above premium player in the RTD coffee space and I'm excited to report that we are ahead of plan on all of our distribution targets.
Truss Canada, a Canadian cannabis joint venture with HEXO is holding strong as the number 1 dollar share position with 6 of the top 10 cannabis beverage skews in Canada.
And our Truss U.S.A joint venture is building on that through their first lineup of hemp-derived CBD beverages in Colorado.
And we have entered the fast-growing RTD cocktails space through an exclusive equity and distribution agreement with Superbird in above premium tequila-based Paloma.
This entire lineup represents tremendous growth for our business and is helping us drive our emerging growth division toward a $1 billion revenue business by 2023.
Last but certainly not least, is how we are investing in our capabilities, our people and our communities.
We have long been recognized as a leader for our environmental efforts, and several weeks ago, we became the first major UK brewer to operate entirely by renewable energy.
Soon, everyone of the 1 billion pints of beer we produced annually in the UK will be made with 100% renewable energy.
And we didn't stop there.
We are removing plastic rings from all of our major cracks across the UK.
In the U.S. this month, we announced our investment in TRU Colors, a North Carolina-based brewery that was founded on the premise that aligning rival gang members under the same roof with a common goal to both mitigate street violence and create economic opportunity.
We're excited to share our knowledge on growing brand positioning and supplier relationships.
And we are excited to be part of the business that is driving positive change and creating economic opportunity.
I can assure you the events of this quarter are not lost on any of us, but as the quarter came to a close, there is land on the horizon.
The on-prem gradually begin to open back up in the UK.
Our industry standard can inventory normalized and our weekly shipments in the U.S., topped 1 million barrels for the first time in nearly a year.
We are making progress on the things that are within our control and we are delivering against our revitalization plan.
And that is what gives me the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for the full year.
That is what gives me confidence in the current expectation that the Board will be in a position to reinstate the dividend in the second half of this year.
That is what gives me confidence that we'll achieve long-term top line growth.
And that is what tells me the future of Molson Coors is bright.
Despite the challenges Gavin mentioned, we are proud of our operational agility and resilience as we are deeply managed through these challenges, while still continuing to execute our revitalization plan.
Now let me take you through our quarterly results and provide an update on our outlook.
Consolidated net sales revenue decreased 11.1% in constant currency, principally due to lower financial volumes, which declined 12% while brand volumes declined 9.1%.
We delivered net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand mix in the U.S. as we continue to premiumize our portfolio.
However, this was more than offset by the on-premise restrictions due to the Coronavirus pandemic and a corresponding negative channel mix as well as the unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S. related to the cyber security incident and the Texas winter storms.
20.53 Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 1.8% in constant currency as the net pricing growth more than offset the negative mix effects in Canada and Europe.
Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation and volume deleverage partially offset by cost savings.
Driving cost inflation was higher transportation costs due to the continued tightening of the freight market in North America as well as higher can sourcing costs as we continue to source additional aluminum cans from all over the world to address the significant off-premise demand for our core brands.
MG&A in the quarter decreased 15.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower marketing spend and discretionary expenses as well as cost savings.
While the timing of our marketing investments was adjusted in areas impacted by the pandemic, we continue to invest as planned beyond our core brands and key innovation.
As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 20.2% on a constant currency basis.
Underlying free cash flow was a use of $271 million for the quarter, an increase in cash use of $54 million from the prior year period driven by lower underlying EBITDA and unfavorable working capital, driven by the timing of payments related to lower volumes, higher non-income tax deferrals due to governmental programs related to the Coronavirus pandemic and incentive payments partially offset by lower capex spend.
Capital expenditures paid were $103 million for the quarter, which were largely focused on our previously announced Golden brewery modernization project.
Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to project timing.
Now let's look at our results by business units.
In North America, our markets experienced varying degrees of on-premise restrictions.
In the U.S., our largest market, we saw progressive reopenings, and while we have seen sequential improvement in the on-premise channel, we are still not back to pre-pandemic level.
In Canada, we saw significant restrictions and closures, while in Latin America, we saw restrictions easing.
In the U.S. brand volumes decreased 7.3% compared to domestic shipment declines of 9.5%, driven by the economy and premium segments.
However, our U.S. above premium brand volumes grew versus the prior year and the segment reached a record high portion of our portfolio, relative to any prior year this quarter since the creation of the MillerCoors joint venture.
Canada brand volumes declined 10.8% primarily due to the on-premise closures, while Latin America brand volumes grew 10.8%.
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.4% in constant currency.
In the U.S., net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.1% driven by positive brand mix made by innovation brand, Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA.
In Canada, negative channel mix more than offset the net pricing increases, while Latin America net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased due to positive sales mix.
North America, underlying EBITDA decreased 13.3% in constant currency, due to the lower net sales revenue and higher COGS per hectoliter partially offset by a 14.4% decrease in MG&A in constant currency.
The increase in COGS per hectoliter was driven primarily by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging material cost, volume deleverage and mix impacts from premiumization, partially offset by cost savings.
The MG&A decline was mainly due to lower marketing spend and discretionary expenses as well as cost savings.
We increased marketing investment behind core innovation brands such as Coors Seltzer, Vizzy and Blue Moon LightSky, and we increased media spending behind our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite.
These increases were more than offset by lower spend in areas impacted by the pandemic such as sports and live entertainment events.
Europe net sales revenue was down 39.5% in constant currency driven by volume declines and negative geographic and channel mix due to on-premise restrictions most meaningfully in the UK, given the on-premise lockdown for the full quarter.
Europe financial volumes decreased 22% and brand volumes decreased 17% driven by a significant decline in brand volumes in the UK.
However, our Central and Eastern European business has performed fairly well and was able to deliver comparable volumes basis the prior year period.
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis declined 10.4% driven by unfavorable geographic channel and brand mix, particularly from our higher margin on-premise focused UK business, partially offset by positive pricing.
Underlying EBITDA was a loss of $38 million compared to a loss of $4.1 million in the prior year driven by gross margin impact of lower volume and unfavorable geographic and channel mix as a result of the pandemic, partially offset by lower MG&A expenses driven by cost mitigation actions.
Turning to the balance sheet.
Net debt was $7.7 billion, down $1.1 billion from March 31, 2020 and we ended the first quarter with a strong borrowing capacity with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion U.S. credit facility as of March 31, 2021.
As for our UK COVID corporate financing facility, it was closed on March 23, 2021, and we had no outstanding borrowings at that time.
Turning to our financial outlook.
We are reaffirming our 2021 annual guidance provided on February 11, 2021.
We expect to deliver mid-single digit net sales revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
We are working aggressively to build inventories and expect domestic shipment trends in the U.S. to begin to exceed brand volume in the second half of the year.
For the year, we maintain our current year goal of shipping to consumption in the U.S. In the U.S., we expect improving on-premise trends in the second quarter as we left essentially full closures in the prior year.
While in Canada, we have seen increasing on-premise restrictions continuing to pressure the on-premise channel.
In Europe, we've seen a gradual opening of the UK on-premise beginning in mid-April to after consumption only and we expect through the phase on-premise reopening later in the second quarter resulting in year-on-year improvement versus the prior period.
We anticipate underlying EBITDA will be flat compared to 2020 as growth is expected to be offset by COGS inflationary headwinds, but more significantly from increased investment to deliver against our revitalization plan.
We intend to increase marketing spend to build on the strength of our core brands and support our successful 2020 launches including Blue Moon LightSky, Vizzy and Coors Seltzer and new innovations like Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA.
With this in mind, we expect significant year-on-year increases in marketing spend over the balance of the year, and most notably in the second quarter.
We expect second quarter marketing spend to be higher than the second quarter 2020 level and to approach second quarter 2019 level.
We also continue to anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, net interest expense of $270 million plus or minus 5% and an effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%.
It also best reminding that in our 2020 -- that in 2020 our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $150 million in tax payment from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the Coronavirus pandemic.
And we currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due.
As 2020 positioned us with greatly improved financial flexibility, better in aiming us to execute our capital allocation priorities, to invest in our business to grow our top line growth and efficiencies, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders in 2021.
We plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and production capacity and capability to support new innovations and growth initiatives, improving efficiencies and advance toward our sustainability goals.
Driven by our commitment to maintaining any time upgrading our investment grade rating, we expect to continue to pay down debt and reaffirm our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.25 times by the end of 2021, and below 3 times by the end of 2022.
And in line with our fourth quarter 2020 earnings comments, we currently anticipate that our Board of Directors will be in a position to reinstate a dividend in the second half of this year.
Now, we are pleased with our ability to adapt and overcome the past incredible challenges we faced in the first quarter.
Our continued progress against our revitalization plan, the agility of our organization in the face of challenges and the commitment and resilience of our people give us the confidence, we can continue to successfully execute our revitalization plan, driving long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress.
