They are based on management's assumptions, which may or may not occur.
In addition, some of our comments today reference non-GAAP adjusted measures.
We expect to file our 10-Q later today.
[Operator Instructions] and will be available on our website following the call.
Please note these calls are designed for the financial community.
I hope you, your families, your work colleagues are safe and well.
Like all of you, we continue to navigate these unusual times.
Cities within our service territory began reopening in the second quarter.
And like many parts of our country, we began seeing an increase in COVID cases in late July.
But it has appeared to plateau lightly.
Now more than ever, we are tapping into our core value of caring for each other and the communities we serve.
From a business perspective, we continue to focus on providing safe and reliable service while ensuring the health and safety of our employees.
We continue to benefit from a conservative business model with stable utility margins.
A majority of our revenues have recovery mechanisms in place to weather normalize and to decouple margins.
We also remain focused on efficient operations.
That, combined with the decline in natural gas prices, has led to natural gas bills that are about 40% lower today than they were 15 years ago, which is very good news for our customers.
The third leg to our strategy is to look for growth that fits our conservative risk profile.
Most recently, this has been a new contractual revenue stream from the North Mist gas storage expansion and, of course, our water and wastewater businesses.
Our solid business strategy allows us to adapt to unforeseen challenges, such as the coronavirus.
And our core values of integrity, safety, caring, service ethic and environmental stewardship are the foundation and guiding principles for all we do.
Safety continues to be a value at the forefront of our minds, and we remain vigilant during this pandemic regarding the safety of our 1,200 employees and, of course, the 2.5 million people that we serve.
Our natural gas and water utilities are critical infrastructure.
We've continued all essential options to provide reliable service while following relevant health and safety guidelines, including guidance from OSHA and the CDC.
We've created a specialized field team that takes extra precautions when responding to calls where there's a known or suspected case of COVID.
In the vein of caring and customer assistance, we temporarily stopped disconnecting customers and charging late fees on past-due bills.
We are also providing financial assistance through a variety of programs, including our corporate philanthropy fund, easy for me to say, our gas assistance program, several state and federal programs and, of course, a special employee giving campaign.
In June, we issued a $17 million bill credit to Oregon customers, which is a record amount under this sharing mechanism.
At the same time, we continue to see strong customer growth.
New construction plus conversions translated into connecting over 13,000 new customers during the last 12 months, which equated to a growth rate of 1.7%.
While we can't predict the full economic effects of the pandemic, we continue to see mitigating factors for our business with our resilient business model, the timing of the onset of the pandemic and our conservative and efficient business operations.
Not only do we care for customers, we also care deeply about our employees, and I am proud of how quickly our employees have adapted adopted rather, new safety procedures and embraced working remotely, all the while they have maintained the highest service and productivity levels.
During this excuse me, we're also reminded of the importance of social justice in our workplace.
As a company, we have publicly stated that racism in any shape or form is not tolerated at Northwest Natural.
And for years, we have actively progressed in the anti-racism and equity agenda, not only internally with our employees, but also founding and supporting wider community diversity initiatives and meeting aggressive goals to provide business opportunities to minority and female-owned businesses.
Today, our culture is one of accountability, creativity and collaboration that is inclusive and supports opportunities for all employees.
This work is not easy, and there are no shortcuts.
We are focused on continuous improvement and we'll keep fostering such an environment, building diverse workforce across all levels in our organization, providing equity in pay and development opportunities and ensuring inclusion so all voices are heard and respected.
Now turning to the progress we've made related to environmental stewardship.
I'm pleased to share that in July, we've reached an important milestone here in Oregon.
Rulemaking was completed on groundbreaking renewable natural gas legislation, what we call Senate Bill 98, which enables us to put renewable natural gas, or RNG, on our system and take the next step in our state's energy transition.
RNG is a zero-carbon resource produced from organic materials like food, agriculture and forestry waste, wastewater or landfills that can be added into the existing natural gas system.
All forms of RNG are supported in the law, including renewable hydrogen.
The law enables us to acquire RNG on behalf of Oregon customers and goes further than any other law by outlining goals for adding as much as 30% RNG into the state's pipeline system by 2050.
It allows up to 5% of a utility's revenue requirement to be used to cover the incremental costs of RNG.
Currently, that equates to about $30 million annually for Northwest Natural.
Gas utilities are also allowed to rate base interconnections with the gas system and could include RNG facilities and rate base, if that is the lowest-cost option for customers.
We're pleased to take this significant step forward with the support of the legislator legislature, governor and regulators.
Last week, Northwest Natural and all parties in the Oregon general rate case filed a comprehensive stipulation with the Public Utility Commission of Oregon.
The filing includes a $45.8 million increase in revenue requirement compared to a requested $71.4 million amount.
This stipulation is based on the previously settled capital components, including a capital structure of 50-50 debt and equity and a return on Equity of 9.4% and a cost of capital of just under 7%.
In addition, the stipulation reflects average rate base of approximately $1.45 billion.
Northwest Natural's filing is subject to OPUC approval.
And if approved, new rates are expected to take effect on November one this year.
This is also the time that our revised purchased gas adjustment, or PGA, takes effect.
This year's PGA forecasts a reduction to customers' bills, which offset the majority of this base rate increase we just settled on.
We commend the commissioners and parties for their ability to continue working virtually under less-than-ideal conditions.
I'll begin with a summary of our second quarter and year-to-date financials, and then discuss the key metrics and financial implications of COVID-19 on our business and guidance for 2020.
I'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% as a result of the return of excess deferred income taxes to our Oregon customers.
Also note that earnings per share comparisons were impacted by the issuance of 1.4 million shares in June of 2019 as we raised equity to fund investments in our gas utility.
For the quarter, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $5.1 million or $0.17 per share compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.07 per share for the same period in 2019.
The decline in earnings for the quarter reflects two key drivers.
First, the second quarter results reflect the financial impacts of COVID-19 on margin, O&M and interest expense.
We estimate the total impact of COVID-19 to be in about approximate to be approximately $4 million or $0.12 per share, most of which hit in the second quarter.
We have recorded a deferral for a portion of these costs with an offsetting reserve until we have more clarity with regulators as to the recoverability of these costs.
Second, last year's second quarter results benefited from the reversal of an earnings test reserved for environmental remediation expenses that we booked in the first quarter equal to $0.11 per share.
Looking at the gas distribution segment.
Utility margin decreased $1 million.
Higher customer rates in Washington, customer growth and revenues from the North Mist expansion project contributed $2.9 million, which was more than offset by a $3.2 million increase in environmental remediation expense due to the reserve release in the prior year.
COVID impacts on margin are estimated to be $1.5 million, including a $700,000 decline in revenues from lower late charges and disconnection fees as we temporarily and voluntarily suspended these charges in March.
In addition, we experienced slightly lower usage from industrial and commercial use customers that were not decoupled.
Utility O&M increased $2.8 million in the quarter as we incurred higher contractor service costs related to pipeline and meter safety as well as moving expenses as we transition to a new headquarters and operations center.
In addition, compensation costs increased related to additional IT staff and higher wages under the new five-year union contract.
Finally, O&M increased $200,000 due to the higher reserve for bad debt related to COVID.
Depreciation expense and general taxes increased $2 million related to our continued investment in our system, including the North Mist gas storage facility, which was placed into rates in May of 2019.
Interest expense increased $1.1 million related to several financings undertaken in March to increase cash on hand as a precautionary measure during a significant market period of significant market volatility amid the early stages of the pandemic.
For the first six months of 2020, we reported net income from continuing operations of $43.1 million or $1.41 per share compared to net income of $45.5 million or $1.56 per share for the same period in 2019.
Last year's results included a regulatory disallowance of $0.23 per share related to an Oregon Commission order.
Excluding that disallowance, on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.79 for 2019.
The $0.38 per share decline is largely due to year-over-year growth in expenses and the effects of COVID-19.
In the gas distribution segment, utility margin increased $100,000.
Higher customer rates in Washington, customer growth and revenues from the North Mist expansion project contributed an additional $10.1 million.
This was partially offset by lower entitlement and curtailment fees related to pipeline constraints in 2019 and warmer weather in 2020 compared to 2019, which collectively reduced margin by $4.9 million.
The remaining $5.2 million decline in utility margin is a result of the March 2019 Oregon order related to tax reform and pension expense.
With the exception of the first quarter pension disallowance, this order has no impact on net income as offsetting adjustments were recognized through expenses and income taxes, as I'll describe in a moment.
Utility O&M and other expenses declined $6.9 million during the first six months of 2020.
This decrease is the result of accounting entries associated with the 2019 Oregon order, which resulted in $14 million of additional expense in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed previously.
This was offset by a $5.8 million increase in underlying O&M related to the cost drivers I described in the quarterly results.
Over the last several years, we have invested in our gas system at historically high levels, and we placed the North Mist gas facility into service.
As a result, depreciation expense increased $4.9 million.
Finally, 2019 utility segment tax expense included a $5.9 million benefit related to implementing the March order with no significant resulting effect on net income.
Net income from our other businesses declined $1.5 million from lower asset management revenues due to less favorable market conditions.
Now regarding the financial effects of COVID-19.
While our business model is resilient and the initial timing of the event occurred after Northwest Natural's peak heating season, we are experiencing some financial impacts related to the pandemic.
Through June 30, we have an estimated $4 million of combined incremental costs and lower revenues.
Based on our experience to date and expectations for the future, we'll closely monitor the following items.
First, we continue to track commercial customer losses as a result of businesses closing their doors and today have not seen a significant change or near-term implications on customer growth, but it is still very early in the economic contraction.
Second, we are also monitoring the loss of late fee revenue and potential bad debt expense.
We have doubled our reserve for bad debts from $800,000 in June 2019 to $1.6 million at June of 2020.
Third, we have experienced some decline in industrial and large commercial customer usage, but have not seen a substantial reduction to date.
As discussed, we took several steps to improve our liquidity position by increasing cash on hand.
As a result, we had over $470 million of cash at the end of the first quarter.
As market conditions have improved, we reduced that to $137 million.
While there is an incremental interest costs associated with these financings, we believe it is relatively inexpensive insurance given the volatility in the market.
We've applied for regulatory deferrals to recover certain of these costs and are working closely with our regulators to reach agreement on the type and amount of costs that will be eligible for recovery.
In addition, we are taking actions to ensure we are operating effectively and efficiently, and these savings also moderate the impact of COVID.
In summary, second quarter results are coming in about where we expected them to be, and we continue to monitor this evolving situation as we approach the next heating season.
Today, we reaffirm guidance for the continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share and guide toward the lower end of the range due to the potential implications of COVID-19.
Guidance also assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant laws, legislation or regulations.
Finally, this guidance excludes any gain related to the sale of Gill Ranch and associated operating results.
These items are reported in discontinued operations.
We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our capital programs.
At this time, we do not expect a material change in our capital expenditure range of $240 million to $280 million.
We are anticipating some lower expenditures related to customer acquisition due to the economic downturn, but the majority of our capex is maintenance in nature and includes some large projects that have already begun.
While we continue to focus on day-to-day operations, we're also advancing key long-term objectives.
As I mentioned earlier, we strive to provide stable earnings while adding new earnings streams with similar risk and cash flow profiles as our regulated gas utility.
We believe the regulated water utility sector fits this profile and aligns with our core capabilities.
Furthermore, the investment potential is promising as the water industry is highly fragmented, and in many cases, these utilities have not been able to adequately invest in their infrastructure.
To that end, in 2017, we began building our water utility business, and I'm very proud of the progress we've made to date with regulatory policies, mechanisms.
While we've seen some decline in activity lately due to travel restrictions related to COVID, so far, in 2020, we closed several transactions, including Suncadia in Washington State and our first water utility in Texas.
In addition, we continue to execute on our tuck-in strategy and around our existing systems.
Just a few days ago, we closed our first municipal transaction in Idaho, acquiring water and wastewater utilities near our falls water system in Idaho Falls and signed another agreement to acquire a small water system in the region.
Cumulatively, we've invested $110 million in this space.
Operationally, the water utilities continue performing well amid the pandemic.
We leveraged our natural gas expertise to follow best practices regarding health and safety guidance for COVID, provide centralized resources and planning as well as provide a larger, stronger balance sheet.
The ability of our water utilities to work together along with our gas utility during this crisis further validates our roll-up strategy.
In closing, our company has weathered many things in the last 162 years, and I'm confident in our ability to handle the challenges at hand.
I stand behind our commitment to customers to provide safe and reliable service, and I believe in our regulated business strategy and the resilience of this team.
