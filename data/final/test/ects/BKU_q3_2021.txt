Let me make a quick few remarks about the -- what we're seeing in our market before we get into our results.
Florida seemed to be in -- caught up in it more than probably any other state.
And there was a lot of concern as to whether that will impact the economy and to what extent.
I'm happy to report three months into it now, Delta seems fairly in the rearview mirror.
I think they have come down to even lower than they were three months back.
So we're happy about that.
But what we were most happy about is also that does not actually have the same kind of impact that previous surges have had on the economy.
I think the economy is learning to deliver these surges at when they happen.
Hopefully, there won't be anymore, but at least over the last three months, we did not see a significant impact to the local economy here or in other parts of the country where we do business.
But it's good to see Delta behind us obviously with a fair amount of pain that we wanted to of the healthcare side.
We -- the Delta surge did put our plans about return to office on hold a little bit.
We have started bringing people back in, in the summer.
We have to take a pause.
Later today, I will be making a call internally and we will be talking about how we're going to restart that process.
Our expectation is that by January -- first week of January, we will be in the new normal, and typically now that slowly started bringing people back.
We will start that but not even for Board meetings, we've not had in-person Board meeting since the start of the pandemic.
Yesterday, the Board met telephonically and decided it was time to -- to start meeting in person.
Our first in-person Board meeting, which will be over two days in the middle of November.
So I'm excited about that, too.
Overall, the economy here in Florida is doing well.
There are obviously widespread labor shortages and supply chain disruptions that everyone has talked about.
We are seeing that.
Our customers are feeling it.
Indirectly, we're feeling that as well.
But it's hard for me to say when those will resolve themselves.
But that is the challenges we're dealing with.
I look at this -- the biggest economic crisis of our lifetime that we went through.
It's 18 months into it.
If all we're dealing with the supply chain issues and labor shortages, I think that's a pretty good place to be.
This could happen a lot worse.
So I take this as actually a victory that these are the issues.
This could happen a lot worse.
Quickly getting into our quarter, we posted net income of $87 million or $0.94 a share.
This compares to $104 million we posted last quarter, which was $1.11 per share.
The annualized returns so far for the 9 months so far -- our return on equity is 12.4% and return on assets of 1.09%.
Net interest income declined slightly to $195 million from $198 million last quarter, but it was up compared to the third quarter of last year, which I think at that time, it was $188 million.
The net contracted 2.33% from 2.37%, mostly because of lower asset yields and less than expected commercial loan growth.
Also, less PPP impact this quarter versus last quarter was also a large reason for that contraction.
Cost of deposits, as we've been telling you, has -- continues to come down.
We dropped at 20 basis points this quarter.
It was 25 last quarters so 5 basis point reduction in the cost of deposits.
On a spot basis, we're actually at 19 basis points and I checked last night, we're down another basis points so like 18 basis points as of yesterday.
So the story on the deposit side continues.
We also had decent growth in deposits especially DDA -- non-interest DDA grew by $324 million.
But we did that very meaningfully -- we're not trying to grow the balance sheet.
Growing the balance sheet and hanging things up in liquidity does not really create value for anyone.
Instead, this quarter we decided not to grow the balance sheet.
We shrank it, freed up capital and bought back stock quite strongly.
In fact one of the things the Board did yesterday when we met is approved another $150 million buyback given that we are going to wind down the authorization that we have based on how quickly we bought stock this quarter.
Also, the fact that the stock was around $40 or so makes it very easy in my -- from my perspective given where our book value is we're trading at such a low multiple so easy.
It doesn't take much of rocket science to figure out, but it's a good buy.
So we've been aggressive and buying back and we've gone through much of that -- much of the authorization.
Loans -- Total loans excluding PPP runoff, they grew by $74 million.
Residential business remained strong as has been the case for the last several quarters.
Commercial segments, the payoffs outpaced production.
On the production side, actually we were pretty happy.
Our production -- we try to go back and say, let's see what we were doing pre-pandemic and we compared the production this quarter to the third quarter of 2019.
Production was actually higher this quarter.
But it's the -- it's two things that we can control, one being payoffs and the other line utilization.
Those have been disappointed [Phonetic] this quarter, which is why it all adds up to only about $74 million of growth in the loan portfolio.
What else, credit, I would say nothing but good news on the credit front.
I know these days, credit is not on people's mind or should always be on everyone's mind, that's the primary risk we take as a bank.
So I'm happy to report on the credit front criticized classified assets declined by $240 million.
Loans under temporary deferral or modified under the CARES Act also declined to $285 million.
They were $497 million I believe at end of last quarter, so almost cut in half.
NPL ratio also got better.
It was 1.21% this quarter.
Last quarter, it was 1.28%.
By the way, that includes the guaranteed portion of SBA loans.
So if you exclude that NPL ratio, it's actually 99 basis points.
The $69 million large commercial loan that we spoke to you about last quarter, it's the resolution of that is moving forward.
We're pretty happy with how we reserve for it and feel very comfortable in that level of reserve.
Net charge-offs annualized was 19 basis points.
Last year, I think we were at about 26 basis points.
So good news on the net charge-offs front as well.
Capital, book value has grown to $34.39, tangible is at $33.53.
Before I hand this over to Tom, just let me say, sort of what are the top in my mind in terms of what we're trying to achieve in the short to medium term sales is basically loan growth but not reaching for loan growth as getting caught up in that and going outside of the risk, that's not acceptable but loan growth restarting the growth engine on the left of the balance sheet is a top priority, continue to improve deposits, while we've made a lot of progress on that.
I think there is more work to be done there, especially in light of the fact that actually it will rise, maybe nine months, maybe less, maybe a little more but some -- on great environment that we have to be ready for it.
And we are basically working our deposit business to be -- that.
In the very short-term is to return to office safely is another priority and then launching in new markets.
The new markets we've talked about last time to you, we don't really have much to share yet because it's not going to ready for primetime, but we have been working for the last three months on finalizing and hopefully over the -- over the course of next threemonths, we will make some announcements and launch one or two new markets.
So I wanted to spend a little time first on deposits, give you a little bit more detail and perspective on some of the things that we're working on and what we achieved in the quarter.
So as Raj said, average non-interest bearing deposits grew by $749 million for the quarter and $2.7 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Period-end non-interest bearing DDA grew by $324 million, while total deposits shrank by $493 million.
So we break down a little bit the $324 million of NII DDA growth for the quarter, it was again broad spread across all geographies, across all business units and very heavily focused on new client acquisition.
I'd also spend a little bit of time working on the deposit portfolio, the work that Raj is talking about is, has been a daily level of kind of bruising work that's not that glamorous but we're working very hard on new account operating relationships, cross-selling within the book, ensuring the ECR rates are set at appropriate levels really working hard on kind of the building blocks of this and I think the two places that you see it, number one, are the continued NII DDA growth obviously in the $324 million, but also secondarily, if you look at service charges, deposit fees on accounts was up 33% for this quarter compared to the same period last year.
So we're really starting to see excellent kind of cadence in the rhythm in both continued NII DDA growth, continued opening of new operating account business, which is really our central focus as a strategy and continuing for a surging in the level of service charge revenue that we have from these accounts.
So all of that is -- is a big part of what Raj talks about when we're talking about the entire deposit mix and the quality of the deposit book.
A little further down, money market accounts declined by $1.1 billion this quarter as we continue to execute the strategy of the quality of the base.
We have looked hard at accounts that we think are highly susceptible to increases in rates once we get into a different interest rate environment and we've taken a lot of steps to ensure that we're moving out deposit accounts right now on a proactive basis as we continue to grow the operating account business and take advantage of that entire dynamic to have just an overall better quality book.
Switching to the loan side, as Raj said, excluding PPP loans, the total portfolio grew by $74 million in the third quarter.
Residential continued to be strong, reflecting the strength in the housing market and the rate environment.
The overall resi portfolio grew by $751 million for the quarter.
Of that, the EBL segment was $50 million and the pure residential correspondent portfolio grew by $701 million.
In the mortgage warehousing business, which is also benefited from a strong housing market, there we saw a decline of $141 million for the quarter.
Most of that is starting to see some normalization in this segment.
This refi activity begins to moderate.
And we see a little bit lower line utilization in this area.
Although we continue to be interested in growing commitments and expect our commitment book to grow in the short-term.
For the C&I business, it was up $13 million for the quarter, including owner occupied CRE loans and I'll talk a little bit more about what we see in that the segment.
The remaining commercial portfolio declined for the quarter.
The largest decline was in CRE including multifamily, which was down by an aggregate of $317 million for the quarter.
The New York multifamily portfolio, which you have been following now with us for a number of years, declined by $76 million for the quarter.
But at this point, we believe that, that's stabilizing.
That's the lowest level of run-off that we have seen in a number of quarters.
And we're actually starting to see some positives in the multifamily market in New York.
I'm sure you all have followed it.
We're starting to see rent increases in the market.
We're starting to see people return back to the New York City.
Multifamily market schools are reopening and things are happening that are driving people returning to the city.
There's been an awful lot of data out in the last couple of months about rent -- rent levels even with concessions improving back to sort of pre-pandemic levels, and we are looking at new opportunities now in the multifamily space within the New York market.
So we're feeling better.
We're feeling good about the portfolio we have today at the current level that it's had and we're feeling better about the short-term growth opportunities within multifamily in New York.
I'd land a little bit more on Raj's comments about production.
When we looked at production across the commercial lines especially C&I, CRE and small business areas, it was better than pre-pandemic levels for the same quarter.
We are seeing a reasonable return of pipeline particularly in the C&I area where we have a large pipeline heading into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year.
So we're seeing clients investing more.
We are still fighting through kind of low utilization rates and even really of the accounts that we're bringing on from an NII DDA perspective that have lines of credit with them even those lines are coming in at pretty low utilization rates, but we think ultimately that patience will pay off for us and as people start making more capex expenditures and growing more solidly in 2022, we believe these relationships including existing ones we have, we'll start to see improvements in these areas.
But actually overall production and pipeline build, we feel pretty optimistic about right now heading into the fourth quarter and heading into -- into 2022.
Yeah, line utilization bottomed out in the first quarter.
It's starting to improve all through the second quarter.
So we were pretty optimistic because we're seeing a very steady trend of improvement.
But in the third quarter, it's really stagnated so it haven't gone down, but it really hasn't come beyond where it was in the second quarter.
So -- And to Tom's point in the new business that we're writing, the line business, it comes on utilization levels, especially in that new business is very low, lower than its existing book as well.
So it's all dry powder so when these bottlenecks and the economy are resolved, this should create growth.
But it's hard for me to say, it was to happen a quarter from now or two quarters and three quarters from now.
But that's sort of what we're seeing.
Tom, you were done?
Yeah, no, I was just [Speech Overlap] I was going to give the PPP update.
As for PPP, $159 million of the First Draw PPP loans were forgiven in Q3.
As of September 30, there was a total of $49 million in PPP loans outstanding under the First Draw program and $283 million of outstanding under the Second Draw program.
We expect to open the forgiveness portal for the Second Draw program next month.
But obviously, this is kind of winding down at this point.
Quick update on deferrals and CARES Act modifications.
Slide 16 in the supplemental deck also provides more detail on this.
For commercial, no commercial loans around short-term deferral as of September 30.
$244 million of commercial loans remained on modified terms under the CARES Act, compared to $436 million at June 30.
The largest decline in loans modified under the CARES Act was $144 million decline in the hotel portfolio.
The hotel portfolio, particularly in Florida, continues to to rebound and if you try to get a hotel in certain areas of Florida lately, good luck, particularly in the Keys and other coastal properties just the occupancy has really returned strongly there.
So we're -- we're feeling good to see that change come about.
Today, $414 million in commercial loans have rolled off modification.
100% of these loans have either paid off or resumed regular payments from residential perspective excluding the Ginnie Mae early buyout portfolio $40 million of loans remained on short-term deferral or have been modified under the longer-term CARES Act prepayment plan at September 30.
Of the $533 million in residential loans that were granted an initial payment deferral $493 million or 92% of rolled off.
Of those that have rolled off, 95% have been paid or are making regular payments.
I think the last thing I'd say on the loan portfolio is also when we look at the $74 million in growth, keep in mind that we had $175 million of payoffs in in criticized and classified loans.
So while it certainly impacted the loan growth number, it did contribute to the overall improvement in the credit quality and we're happy to see that.
Give a little bit more detail on the numbers for the quarter, starting with the NIM.
The NIM did decline this quarter to 2.33% from 2.37%.
The PPP fee recognition had a bigger impact on the NIM last quarter than it did this quarter.
If we factor out the impact of PPP fees and the impact of increasing prepayment fees on some of our securities, the NIM actually would have been flat quarter-over-quarter.
Loan growth was ready this quarter, not commercial and we seen more commercial growth as opposed to residential growth we likely would have seen some uptick in that NIM.
The yield on loans decreased to 3.45% from 3.59% last quarter, recognition of PPP fees, the differential in that quarter-over-quarter if it hadn't been for that the yield on loans would have declined by only 6 basis points for the quarter and most of that 6 basis points really was attributable to the shift from residential to -- from commercial to residential.
Eventually, obviously, we believe that level will swing back the other way.
I know you've been asking me, so I'll answer you now.
There are still $8.1 million worth of deferred fees on PPP loans remaining to be recognized almost all of that $8 million relates to the Second Draw program.
So I don't really think we'll see much of that in the fourth quarter.
Yield on securities declined from 1.56% to 1.49% and accelerated prepayments, which we think some day has to come to an end but keeps not coming to an end.
It just keeps getting faster on that mortgage-backed securities accounted for almost all of that quarterly decline in yields.
The total cost of deposits declined by 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
The cost of interest bearing deposit is down 6 basis points.
And our best expectation right now is that NIM would remain relatively stable over the fourth quarter, but obviously there are things that contribute to that that are a little bit difficult for us to predict, but that's our best expectation as of now.
And we can comfortably say the cost of deposits will continue to grow for at least to one quarter.
With respect to the allowance and the provision, overall, the provision for credit losses for the quarter was a recovery of $11.8 million.
Slide 9 through 11 of our deck provide further details on the ACL.
The ACL declined from 77 basis points to 70 basis points over the course of the quarter.
Most significant drivers to that change, $2.3 million decrease related to the economic forecast.
This is becoming less impactful than it has been in prior quarters, which is not surprising as things start to stabilize, a $4.5 million decrease due to charge-offs, another $3.7 million due to a variety of changes in the portfolio, including the mix of new production and ad bids [Phonetic], the further shift to loan segments with lower expected loss rates primarily residential impact on PDs of an improving borrower financial performance, risk rating changes, etc, and a $5.9 million decrease in the amount of qualitative overlays and this is mainly just a shift things that are now being captured by the models.
This last quarter, we didn't think the models were adequately capturing.
The largest component of the reduction in the reserve with the CRE portfolio.
The CRE model was particularly sensitive to unemployment, which improved this quarter and the commercial property forecast also improved, particularly for retail and multifamily, where we saw improving forecast in vacancy rates.
There was also a reduction in criticized, classified pre-loans, which impacts the reserve.
We also saw the resi reserve come down.
This was caused by residential loans continuing to come off deferral and resuming payments and changes in the economic forecast related to unemployment and long-term interest rates also had an impact.
Remind you that almost 20% of the resi both this government insured and actually carries no reserve.
C&I reserves actually ticked up a little bit as a percentage of loans this quarter.
With respect to risk rating migration, if you see -- you can see some details on this in Slides 23 through 25 of our deck, the total criticized and classified commercial loans declined by $240 million this quarter, most of that within the substandard accruing category, which declined by $252 million.
Special Mention ticked up a little an substandard non-accruing ticked down a little.
Total non-performing loans decreased $277 million this quarter from $293 million at June 30.
The decline in criticized and classified assets really occurred across pretty much all portfolio segments with the largest decline in CRE.
Looking at other income and expense, there's not really anything material to call out this quarter.
On the year-to-date basis, we had initially guided to mid single digit increase in non-interest expense and that's the looks like where we're going to -- likely going to land by the end of the year and I would also note the 33% year-over-year increase in deposit service charges and fees, which Tom mentioned and we're pretty happy about that.
ETR was a little lower this quarter mainly due to a temporary reduction in the Florida tax rate.
Last point I'll make, you'll see in the next couple of weeks, we'll be filing an S-3, a Shelf registration, we don't read anything into that that you all don't feel like you need to call me, our Shelf registration is expiring and we just want to have an active shelf on file.
We're not planning anything so but you'll see that.
Let's jump into it.
