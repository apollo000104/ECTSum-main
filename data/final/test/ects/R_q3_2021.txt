These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in economic, business, competitive, market, political and regulatory factors.
I'll also discuss today's announcement of our plan to acquire Midwest Warehouse & Distribution System.
John will take you through our third quarter results, which exceeded our expectation again this quarter and review our disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on returns.
I'll then discuss our updated 2021 outlook.
Let me start with some key highlights about the market and our results.
Long term transportation and logistics outsourcing trends continue to support our growth strategy and investments.
Trends in warehousing and distribution as well as in e-commerce fulfillment and last mile delivery of big and bulky items have continued to accelerate since the pandemic began.
Our strategic investments remain focused on leveraging these favorable outsourcing trends.
Unprecedented challenges impacting labor, supply chains and truck production are providing us with additional growth opportunities because they help drive companies to make long term outsourcing decisions.
We're seeing record new contract wins in supply chain and dedicated, which we fully expect will contribute to long term profitable growth.
FMS is also benefiting as companies are looking to source truck capacity in this extremely tight market.
Consistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we're investing in our higher return logistics businesses through our planned acquisition of Midwest Warehouse & Distribution System, which adds multi client warehousing capabilities in supply chain and accelerates growth.
We also announced plans to return capital to shareholders over time through discretionary and anti dilutive share repurchase programs.
Use of the new discretionary program is anticipated to occur over time, dependent on several factors, including balance sheet leverage, the availability of quality acquisitions and the stock price.
We now expect to achieve ROE in the range of 18% to 19% for the full year.
The team has done an excellent job of leveraging favorable pricing trends in used vehicle sales and rental resulting in outperformance in both these areas.
In addition, we've continued to increase lease pricing resulting in improved portfolio returns and a 4% increase in revenue per average active lease vehicle.
We expect additional benefits going forward as leases are renewed and repriced and as we utilize data analytics to further segment customer pricing based on application, equipment type and other key drivers of lease returns.
Moving to cash flow.
We generated strong year to date free cash flow of over $800 million and have increased our full year free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our prior forecast of $650 million to $750 million.
Our full year forecast reflects an estimated cash flow benefit of $400 million from deferred capital expenditures due to OEM delivery delays as well as record proceeds from the sale of our used vehicles.
With balance sheet leverage currently well below our target range, we have additional capacity to enhance shareholder value by deploying capital consistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy.
slide five provides an overview of the investments we're making to drive accelerated growth in supply chain and dedicated, a key element of our strategy to generate higher returns.
Developing new and enhanced products such as Ryder Last Mile, e-commerce fulfillment and freight brokerage provides opportunities to leverage profitable growth areas.
Innovative technology enables us to deliver value added logistics solutions that are in high demand.
Last quarter, I highlighted Ryder Last Mile offering.
This quarter, I'll discuss RyderShare, our real time freight visibility and collaboration tool that has proven to be a key differentiator in winning new business.
Sales and marketing are key to our brand awareness and ensuring customers are aware of our full array of supply chain capabilities.
Our Ever better campaign and the increased digital marketing presence have driven a significant increase in qualified sales leads.
We're also expanding our sales force and investing in their capabilities to drive additional growth opportunities.
Strategic M&A opportunities, such as our planned acquisition of Midwest, are focused on adding new capabilities, geographies and/or industry verticals.
These opportunities are an important way to accelerate growth especially in Supply Chain and Dedicated.
Ryder Ventures, our corporate venture capital fund aims to invest $50 million over five years through direct investment in start-ups.
Our investments here advanced strategic relationships where we typically are working together to develop new products and capabilities that benefit our customers and solidify our position as an industry leader.
We've made investments in numerous exciting areas such as e-commerce micro fulfillment and digital driver staffing and are working with these start-ups to address important customer needs.
We also recently announced strategic alliances with several autonomous technology firms, which enables us to leverage our expertise in asset management, maintenance and transportation, positioning us as an innovative leader in this emerging space.
slide six takes a closer look at RyderShare, an innovative digital product that combines Ryder's nearly 90 years of logistics experience with best in class technology.
RyderShare provides users with real time freight visibility throughout the life cycle of an order as well as the opportunity to share information between suppliers, carriers and shippers on one platform with Ryder's team of supply chain experts managing exceptions.
RyderShare users benefit from improved service, from their, for their customers, increased employee productivity and the ability to readily access information from one source for decision making.
Almost 70% of Ryder's transportation volume and supply chain and dedicated now runs through RyderShare.
The platform has processed over 4.4 million transactions and has over 5,300 users to date.
We're also excited about our recent launch of RyderShare for warehousing.
This enhancement makes RyderShare, the only visibility platform that connects transportation with warehousing.
We expect this will be a key differentiator in winning new business.
Total company results for the third quarter on page seven.
Operating revenue of $2 billion in the third quarter increased 11% from the prior year, reflecting revenue growth across all three of our business segments.
Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.55 in the third quarter as compared to $1.21 in the prior year.
Higher earnings reflect improved performance in aftermaths from higher rental, used vehicle sales and lease results, as well as a declining depreciation expense impact related to prior residual value estimate changes.
Return on equity, our primary financial metric, reached 15.7% for the trailing 12 month period.
ROE reflects higher earnings from rental, used vehicle sales and declining depreciation expense impact.
Improved lease performance also contributed to higher ROE and reflects the impact of our pricing initiatives.
year to date free cash flow was strong at $829 million, although down from the prior year when capital expenditures were unusually low due to COVID.
Turning to FMS results on page eight.
Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue increased 8%, reflecting 37% higher rental revenue, driven by strong demand and higher pricing.
Rental pricing increased 9%, primarily due to higher rates across all vehicle classes.
FMS realized pre-tax earnings of $186 million, up by $170 million from the prior year.
$93 million of this improvement is from higher gains on used vehicles sold and a lower depreciation expense related to prior residual value estimate changes.
Improved rental and lease results also significantly contributed to increased FMS earnings.
Rental utilization on the power fleet was a record 83% in the quarter and well above the prior year's 71%.
Results also benefited from ongoing momentum from lease pricing initiatives, partially offset by a 3% smaller average active lease fleet.
FMS EBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 14.9% in the third quarter and surpassed the company's long term target of high single digits.
For the trailing 12 month period, it was in line with the target at 9.7%.
page nine highlights global used vehicle sales results for the quarter.
Used vehicle market conditions remain robust due to strong freight activity and timing supply from truck production constraints.
Higher sales proceeds reflect significantly improved market pricing.
Globally, year over year proceeds more than doubled for both tractors and trucks.
While sequentially tractor proceeds were up 32% and truck proceeds were up 27% versus the second quarter 2021.
As you may recall, last year, we provided a sensitivity noting that a 10% price increase for trucks and a 30% price increase for tractors in the U.S. would be needed by 2022 in order to maintain current residual value estimates.
Our current tractor and truck proceeds significantly exceed these levels.
Average current pricing in the U.S. for tractors and trucks is well above our residual value estimates used for depreciation purposes.
As such, we are comfortable with our residual value estimates and we do not anticipate the need for any significant adjustments at this time.
During the quarter, we sold 4,900 used vehicles, down 44% versus the prior year and down 18% sequentially, reflecting lower inventory levels.
Used vehicle inventory was 3,500 vehicles at quarter end, below our target range of 7,000 to 9,000 vehicles.
Turning to supply chain on page 10.
Operating revenue versus the prior year increased 14% due to new business higher volumes and increased pricing.
Growth was partially offset by the impact of supply chain disruptions and automotive production activity.
We expect this disruption to continue to impact our automotive customers until global supply chains normalize, and we continue to work with our customers to mitigate the impact.
We have included an estimated impact from potential shutdowns in our balance of year forecast as the situation remains fluid.
SCS pre-tax earnings decreased 62% and trailing SCS EBT as a percent of op revenue of 6.2% was below target.
This reflects lower automotive earnings, higher labor costs and strategic investments, partially offset by positive earnings from these business.
We anticipate the pricing adjustments we're implementing to improve SCS EBT percentages in the first half of 2022 and to move around the target range or move to around the target range in the second half of next year.
Moving to dedicated on page 11.
Operating revenue increased 16% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing.
New contract wins and DTS continue to be robust with year to date sales results already reaching full year record levels.
New contract wins are driven by ongoing secular outsourcing trends as well as current labor and supply chain challenges that are driving companies to make long term outsourcing decisions.
We're signing larger deals across a diversified industry base and new contract wins are also benefiting from cross selling opportunities from FMS and SCS.
DTS pre-tax earnings decreased 54% and trailing DTS EBT as a percent of op revenue was below target at 5.3%.
This reflects increased labor and insurance costs partially offset by positive earnings from new business.
Although unprecedented labor challenges are affecting current results in DTS and SCS, we are increasing our recruiting efforts and successfully working with our customers to implement price adjustments to address higher market costs.
We're encouraged by the early progress we're making on these price adjustments as we continue to deliver the superior service our customers expect.
We're confident that our new and expanded customer base and pricing adjustments will improve DTS EBT percentages in the first half of '22 with it moving to around our target range in the second half.
Turning to slide 12.
Lease capital spending of $807 million was above prior year's plan due to increased lease sales activity in the year.
Lease returns are benefiting from pricing initiatives and support a more normalized lease capital investment.
Rental capital spending of $583 million increased significantly year-over-year, reflecting a higher planned investment in the rental fleet.
We plan to grow the rental fleet by approximately 15% in 2021 and in order to capture the increased demand we've seen from strong e-commerce and overall freight activity.
Our full year 2021 forecast for gross capital expenditures of $1.9 billion to $2 billion is below our initial forecast range.
This reflects an estimated impact of $400 million from deferred vehicle purchases due to OEM delivery delays that Robert highlighted earlier.
Turning to slide 13.
Our 2021 free cash flow forecast has increased to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our previous forecast of $650 million to $750 million.
The full year forecast reflects our strategy to balance moderate growth in the capital-intensive FMS business, while generating positive free cash flow over the cycle.
It also reflects the impact from delayed OEM deliveries and record proceeds from used vehicles sold and, as noted earlier.
Balance sheet leverage declined due to higher earnings and cash flow and is expected to remain below the low end of our target range this year.
Importantly, we now expect to achieve ROE of 18% to 19% this year due to stronger than expected performance in FMS and a declining depreciation impact.
Higher year to date comparable EBITDA, which excludes the impact of gains and losses on used vehicle sales, reflects revenue growth and improved operating performance.
Turning to slide 14.
I'd like to review our capital allocation priorities which are focused on creating long term shareholder value by investing in high return opportunities that generate positive free cash flow over the cycle.
Our first priority for capital is investing in high return organic growth opportunities, which includes moderate FMS lease fleet growth and accelerating growth in SCS and DTS.
In our FMS business, we estimate investments of between $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion annually, and that is the amount needed to replace leased vehicles as contracts are renewed and to refresh the existing rental fleet.
We also estimate investing between $200 million to $500 million in annual fleet growth, which represents lease fleet growth of approximately 2,000 to 4,000 vehicles with commensurate growth in rental.
Returns in both lease and rental are expected to continue to benefit from ongoing pricing initiatives.
Investments to accelerate growth in our higher return and less capital intensive supply chain and dedicated businesses as well as technology investments that expand or enhance our capabilities are also key priorities for organic growth capital.
Targeted acquisitions such as our planned acquisition of Midwest, are focused on adding new services capabilities or industry verticals and provide us with important opportunities for long-term profitable growth.
Accretive tuck-in acquisitions that supplement our base business as well as investments by RyderVentures provide additional opportunities for us.
Our capital allocation strategy is also focused on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Ryder has made an uninterrupted quarterly dividend payments for more than 45 years.
Our dividend growth rate over the past 10 years is 7% and our current dividend yield is around 3%.
The new share repurchase programs discussed earlier allow for both anti-dilutive and discretionary share repurchases.
We remain committed to offsetting dilution through the use of the anti-dilutive program.
The discretionary program is planned to be utilized over time to manage leverage and its usage will be dependent on several factors, including balance sheet leverage, the availability of quality acquisitions and stock price.
Our capital allocation priorities are focused on achieving ROE of 15% or higher over the cycle while generating positive free cash flow and maintaining target leverage.
Turning now to our earnings per share outlook on page 15.
We're raising our full year comparable earnings per share forecast to $8.40 to $8.50, up from our prior forecast of $7.20 to $7.50 and well above a loss of $0.27 in the prior year.
We're also providing a fourth quarter comparable earnings per share forecast of $2.36 to $2.46, significantly above the prior year of $0.83.
Used vehicle sales, rental and lease are the key drivers of higher expected full year results.
Gains are expected to be down slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, reflecting strong pricing, partially offset by fewer vehicles sold due to low inventory levels.
Looking ahead to 2022, we expect both higher revenue and earnings.
Record new contract wins in 2021 in supply chain and dedicated are expected to benefit 2022 revenue growth.
Supply chain and dedicated margins are expected to improve in the first half of next year and move toward the target range in the second half, reflecting price increases to address higher labor costs, barring any further market disruptions.
We expect strong freight conditions and truck production challenges to continue into 2022 benefiting FMS results.
Declining depreciation expense impact is expected to benefit year over year earnings comparisons by $85 million.
However, this is expected to be fully offset by higher book values on vehicles being sold next year.
Used vehicle sales volumes are expected to be flat to modestly higher.
Used truck pricing for the year is expected to be flat to modestly higher in 2022, remaining strong through at least the middle of the year and potentially declining in the second half if new truck production ramps up and used vehicle inventories and the overall market begin to normalize.
Free cash flow next year is expected to decline, largely reflecting the $400 million capital expenditure deferral from 2021 into 2022 due to OEM delivery delays.
Given the unusual OEM production situation, it would be appropriate to look at combined free cash flows in 2021 and 2022.
Overall, we're pleased with the trends that favor outsourcing and our efforts in sales, marketing and new product development.
We're confident in the actions we're taking to increase returns, including higher pricing to offset labor challenges, positioning us well for 2022.
Before we go to questions, please note that we expect to file our 10-Q later today.
