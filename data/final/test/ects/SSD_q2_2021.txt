Now I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.
I'll begin with the summary of our key second quarter performance, drivers and initiatives.
Brian will then walk you through our financials and updated full year 2021 business outlook in greater detail.
We experienced strong business momentum in the second quarter, generating net sales of $410.3 million which grew 18% over the prior quarter and 25.8% over the prior year period.
Sales growth was primarily driven by the implementation of two product price increases during the quarter along with marginal increases in sales volume.
Throughout the quarter, we were very pleased to be able to continue meeting the needs of our customers by providing them with our trusted product solutions typically within 48 hours or less.
This is despite the current environment marked by the increasing prevalence of global supply chain constraints, limited steel availability and a tight labor market.
The recent price increases we implemented drove significantly higher gross margins for the second quarter, which increased to 47.9% from 46.7% in the prior quarter and 45.9% in the year ago period.
As a result, our income from operations improved to $101.7 million and led to strong earnings per diluted share of a $1.66.
Looking at our sales results in more detail, the majority of the increase we experienced both sequentially and over the prior year period was a result of two price increases that became effective during the second quarter.
These price increases were in direct response to rising material costs.
Effective April 5, we implemented price increases ranging from 5% to 12% depending on the product mix for certain of our wood connectors, fasteners, and concrete products in the U.S. On June 16, a second price increase ranging from 6% to 12% primarily on our wood connector products in the U.S. also went into effect.
As the price of steel continued to rise throughout the second quarter, we announced a third price increase in June in the range of 7% to 15% across a variety of our product lines in the U.S. which will become effective for most customers in mid-August.
Consistent with our historical business practice, our customers received at least a 60-day advance notification for price increases along with a clause that reduces significant pre-buying.
This enables us to manage our inventory levels in this challenging market.
Importantly, while we expect these price increases will support our gross margin levels throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021, our gross margins in the first half of 2021 reflect an average cost of steel sourced prior to or earlier into this surge in steel market together with steel purchased more recently at significantly higher prices.
These higher prices are in the range of more than double those earlier costs.
We are continuing to acquire higher priced raw materials which we currently anticipate will result in gross margin compression beginning in late fiscal 2021 and into fiscal 2022.
Brian will discuss this impact in more detail during his remarks.
Turning back to our sales performance, we experienced mixed trends in the various forms of distribution channel we serve including our home center channel and other distribution channels to contractors and lumber yards.
While our momentum with home centers continued, our sales reflected a high-teens percentage decline in this channel year-over-year given the challenging comparison with lapping the return of Lowe's as a home center customer in the second quarter of 2020.
As a reminder, the home center channel includes both our home centers, as well as co-op customers and is where we see much of our repair and remodel and DIY business.
Last year, we experienced elevated volume levels as we began our load-in and shipped our connector products into Lowe's stores.
We expect to experience a similar trend next quarter as we lap the elevated volumes from our mechanical anchor and fastener load-ins at Lowe's in the third quarter of 2020.
Offsetting the decline in the home center channel was double-digit growth in our other distribution channels during the quarter.
This was due to the aforementioned sales price increases and ongoing strength in demand for our products which benefited from upward trends in U.S. housing starts.
As we generally experience a multi-month lag in demand from the time of housing starts the second quarter reflected strength in the housing starts during the first quarter of 2021, which grew by nearly 9% year-over-year.
Finally in Europe, our second quarter sales improved over the prior year on a local currency basis given strengthening demand compared to the prior year where we experienced government mandated COVID-19 related closures, which resulted in lower sales volumes.
Sales in Europe were also supported by our ability to continue meeting out customer needs due to our solid inventory management practices amid broader supply chain shortages.
I'll now turn to a high level discussion on our three growth initiatives, which we first introduced earlier this year during our Virtual Analysts Investor Day event on March 23.
Our growth initiatives focus on the following five markets, which I'll name in no particular order of priority; OEM, which is Original Equipment Manufacturers, repair, remodel and do it yourself; mass timber, concrete and structural steel.
Importantly, we currently have existing products, test results, distribution and manufacturing capabilities in place for all five of our growth initiatives.
In these markets, we are focused on organic growth opportunities through expansion into new markets within our core competencies of wood and concrete products, as well as inorganic growth opportunities through licensing, purchased IP and traditional M&A.
In order to appropriately grow in the first three markets, that would be the OEM, DIY, R&R and Mass Timber, we aspired to be a leader in the engineered low-graded construction fastening solutions given each of these markets have a broader product opportunity within Fastenings Solutions.
In addition, we're striving to be a stronger leader in building technology by continuing to provide innovative tools and solutions that both help our customers with design and options management, while simultaneously enabling them to select and specify the right Simpson solution for the job.
We expect technology advancements would drive enhanced growth in all of our key growth initiatives as well as across all of Simpson in general.
Today, each of our growth initiatives are in a different stage of development.
We are confident in our ability to execute them based on our strong business model which emphasizes engineering expertise, deep-rooted relationships with our top builders, engineers, contractors, code officials and our distributors, along with our ongoing commitment to testing, research and innovation.
We believe these initiatives will continue to position Simpson for above-market growth and we'll keep you apprised of any significant updates as they arise.
Finally, I'd like to take a brief moment to touch on our capital allocation strategy.
As our business continues to generate strong cash flow, we remain focused on appropriately balancing our growth and stockholder return priorities.
We will prioritize investing in our growth initiatives in areas such as engineering, talented market and sales personnel and testing capabilities.
M&A also remains a high key area of focus in order to expand our product lines and develop complete solutions for the markets in which we operate as well as potential M&A opportunities in areas of direct alignment or support on our key growth initiatives.
To assist with these efforts, we're looking to other avenues such as venture capital expertise to help identify potential strategic acquisitions or investments including innovative technologies of interest in the building space.
In regard to stockholder returns, during the quarter, our board of directors approved the change to our capital return threshold to 50% of Simpson's free cash flow as compared to our previous threshold of 50% of our cash flow from operations.
This change was made to better align our capital return thresholds with our growth initiative strategies and investments.
We remain committed to returning value to our stockholders in the form of opportunistic share repurchases and dividends moving forward.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong second quarter financial and operational performance.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to build on the continuing momentum we are experiencing including strong housing starts.
We look forward to continuing to provide our customers with Simpson's industry-leading solutions supported by our long-standing relationships, technical and field support, strong inventory position, and consistent product availability.
I'm pleased to discuss our second quarter financial results with you today.
Now turning to our results, as Karen highlighted, our consolidated net sales increased 25.8% to $410.3 million.
Within the North America segment, net sales increased 22.2% to $350.6 million primarily due to product price increases that took effect in April and June of 2021 in an effort to offset rising material costs along with marginally higher sales volumes.
We also continue to benefit from solid trends in our distributor channel, which reflected increased demand from ongoing strength in U.S. housing starts.
In Europe, net sales increased to 51% to $56.4 million primarily due to higher sales volumes compared to last year's COVID-19-related slowdown.
Europe sales also benefited by approximately $5.3 million of positive foreign currency translations resulting from some Europe currencies strengthening against the United States dollar.
Wood construction products represented 87% of total sales compared to 86% and concrete construction products represented 13% of total sales compared to 14%.
Consolidated gross profit increased by 31.1% to $196.4 million which resulted in a stronger Q2 gross profit margin of 47.9% compared to last year.
Gross margin increased by 200 basis points primarily due to the price increases Karen discussed earlier, which were partially offset by higher material costs.
On a segment basis, our gross margin in North America increased to 49.9% compared to 47.4%.
While in Europe, our gross margin increased to 36% compared to 35.1%.
From a product perspective, our second quarter gross margin on wood products was 47.4% compared to 46.2% in the prior-year quarter and was 47.5% for concrete products compared to 40.7% in the prior-year quarter.
Now, turning to our second quarter costs and operating expenses.
As a reminder, last year, we curtailed expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result, total operating expenses were $94.7 million, an increase of $17.1 million or approximately 22%.
As a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses were 23.1% compared to 23.8%.
Research and development and engineering expenses increased 16.2% to $14.2 million primarily due to increased personnel costs, cash profit sharing and professional fees.
Selling expenses increased 23.6% to $33.2 million due to increased personnel costs, sales commissions travel and entertainment expenses and professional fees.
On a segment basis, selling expenses in North America were up 20.3%; and in Europe, they were up 36%.
General and administrative expenses increased 22.7% to $47.4 million primarily due to personnel costs, cash profit sharing and professional and legal fees offset by a lower stock-based compensation.
Our solid top line performance combined with our stronger Q2 gross margin helped drive a 40.9% increase in consolidated income from operations to $101.7 million compared to $72.2 million.
In North America, income from operations increased 31.8% to $95.1 million, primarily due to increased gross profit, partly offset by higher operating expenses.
In Europe, income from operations increased 117.8% to $5.9 million primarily due to increased sales volumes and gross profit.
On a consolidated basis, our operating income margin of 24.8% increased by approximately 270 basis points from 22.1%.
Our effective tax rate increased to 26.9% from 25.8%.
Accordingly, net income totaled $72.5 million or $1.66 per fully diluted share, compared to $53.5 million or $1.22 per fully diluted share.
Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow; our balance sheet remained healthy with ample liquidity to operate our day-to-day operations.
At June 30, cash-and-cash equivalents totaled $305.8 million, a decrease of $9.7 million compared to June 30, 2020.
As of June 30, 2021, the full $300 million on our primary credit line was available for borrowing and we remain debt free mostly unchanged from year end.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we entered into a fourth amendment to our credit facility, which extended the terms of the agreement from July 23, 2022 to July 12, 2026 and modified certain covenants to provide us with additional flexibility.
Our inventory position of $310.3 million at June 30 increased by $13.6 million from our balance at March 31, primarily due to the increases we saw in steel prices over the first half of the year, partially offset by a reduction in pounds on-hand.
We continue to carefully manage raw material inventory purchases in the environment of rising costs and limited supplies, all while striving to maintain our high levels of customer service and on-time delivery standards.
As a result of our improved profitability and effective working capital management, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $63.8 million for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $38.9 million or 156%.
We used approximately $8.8 million for capital expenditures during the quarter and paid $10 million in dividends to our stockholders.
Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that on July 14, 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share.
The dividend will be payable on October 28, 2021 to stockholders of record as of October 7, 2021.
As a reminder, in early May, our board of directors approved $0.02 or 8.7% increase in our dividend per share.
We are pleased to have increased our quarterly dividend, reflecting our strong financial performance and continued commitment to returning capital to stockholders.
Prior to this, we had last raised our quarterly dividend by $0.01 or 4.5% per share in April 2019.
We did not increase our dividend in 2020 as a result of our focus on cash preservation at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of June 30, 2021 we had the full amount of our $100 million share repurchase authorization available, which remains in effect through the end of 2021.
Given our confidence in our business and our expectation that our strategic initiative will continue to drive improved operational performance and a higher return on invested capital, we expect we'll remain both active and opportunistic as it relates to share repurchase activity.
Based on business trends and conditions as of today, July 26, we are updating certain elements of our guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2021 as follows.
We are tightening our operating margin outlook to now be in the range of 19.5% to 21% compared to our previous estimate of 19.5% to 22%.
The current outlook reflects two quarters of actual results, the impact of our recent price increase announcement, rising raw material input costs, and the stronger than anticipated demand trends that we've been experiencing in 2021.
In addition, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% including both federal and state income tax rates.
And finally, we are updating our capital expenditure outlook.
For 2021 we have authorized capex in the range of $55 million to $60 million including approximately $15 million to $20 million that will be used for safety and maintenance capex.
At this time, only a small amount of our capex spend is related to pursuing our growth initiatives Karen outlined earlier in the call.
I'd also like to provide some additional commentary regarding our margin expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.
Based on our current expectations, we are anticipating continued raw material cost pressure in late 2021 and into 2022.
As Karen noted, our gross margins in the first half of 2021 reflect an average cost of steel sourced prior to or early into the rising steel market together with steel purchased more recently at much higher prices.
As we work through our on-hand inventory and continue to continue to buy raw material at these much higher prices, our anticipated costs of goods sold are expected to increase significantly in the back half of fiscal 2021 and into 2022 even if prices for raw material begin to decline, which will adversely affect our margins as the impacts from averaging raw material costs typically lags our price increases.
As a result, we currently expect a roughly 300-basis-point to 400-basis-point decline in operating margins for the full-year 2022 when compared to 2021.
Despite near-term pressures, we continue to focus on the long-range view, a key company value put in place by our Founder, Barclay Simpson.
As discussed during our Analyst and Investor Day, we continue to believe we can maintain an industry-leading operating margin in the high teens range annually in the long term, a key goal in our five-year company ambitions.
In summary, we're very pleased with our solid second quarter financial results and operating performance.
We remain confident in our ability to execute against our strategic, operational and financial initiatives along with being able to support current and future demand trends.
We look forward to updating you on progress in the coming quarters.
As Brian mentioned in summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter results.
We continue to manage the key areas of our business that we can control while navigating the current macroeconomic environment, which is characterized by our ongoing rise in steel prices.
While these factors will result in a notable compression to our margins in fiscal 2022, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our five-year company ambitions that we unveiled at our Analyst Investor Day in March.
Our first ambition is we want to strengthen our values-based culture.
Our Simpson's strong tie employees are our most important asset and we will continue to engage with them to ensure relentless customer focus that they're involved in leadership programs and instill a safety-first culture.
Second, we want to be a partner of choice in all aspects of our business.
Third, we strive to be an innovative leader in our products categories.
Fourth, we aim to continue our above market growth relative to U.S. housing starts.
This, we will continue to target an operating income margin that remains within the top quartile of our proxy peers.
While we expect increases in our operating expenses in the near-term to support our growth initiatives, our goal over the long-term is to expand our operating income margin from historical averages supported by enhanced revenue from our growth initiatives.
And finally, we'll continue targeting a return on invested capital that remains in the top quartile of our proxy peers.
We commend you for your dedication to safety and for working hard every day to achieve our mission of providing solutions to help people build and design safer, stronger structures.
