Joining me on the call today are Kent Masters, chief executive officer; and Scott Tozier, chief financial officer.
Our GBU Presidents, Raphael Crawford, Netha Johnson, and Eric Norris are also available for Q&A.
Please also note that some of the comments made today refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
Scott will provide more details on our financial results, outlook, and capital allocation priorities.
And finally, I'll walk you through our 2022 objectives.
2021 was a transformative year for Albemarle.
Our strategic execution and ability to effectively manage the challenges of the global pandemic enabled us to capitalize on the strength of the lithium and bromine markets and generate results that exceeded expectations.
For the year, excluding our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in June of 2021, we increased net sales by 11% to $3.3 billion, which was in line with our previous guidance.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 13% in 2021 to $871 million, surpassing the upper end of our guidance.
Looking ahead, our outlook for 2022 has improved based primarily on favorable market conditions for lithium and bromine.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 35% and 55% versus 2021, excluding fine chemistry services.
To continue driving this growth, we are focused on quickly bringing capacity online with accelerated investments.
La Negra 3 and 4 is currently in commercial qualification, and we expect to start realizing first sales from this facility in the second quarter.
In November, we achieved mechanical completion of the first train at Kemerton.
The construction team is now dedicated to the second train, and we will be able to leverage our experience from train one to improve efficiencies and timeliness of this project.
And we recently signed a nonbinding letter agreement to explore the expansion of our MARBL joint venture with increased optionality and reduced risk.
Now looking at Slide 5.
We introduced this slide early last year to lay out our 2021 objectives designed to support the four pillars of our strategy: to grow profitably, to maximize productivity, to invest with discipline, and to advance sustainability.
Virtually all the goals we set last year were met or exceeded despite challenges related to severe weather, supply chain issues, and the ongoing effects of the pandemic.
The focus of our people around the world is what drove our strong year and underscores our ability to deliver on our commitments.
These accomplishments have also set the stage for us to take advantage of the growth opportunities ahead.
Just as important as driving growth is an ongoing dedication to strong ESG values.
I'm very proud of what you see on Slide 6.
Since I became CEO in 2020, one of my main priorities has been continued improvement in sustainability.
I'm pleased to see that these efforts are increasingly being recognized externally, but it certainly isn't a new initiative for Albemarle.
Sustainability is not just doing the right thing but also doing it the right way.
For example, the lithium market is expected to see significant demand growth in the coming years.
As a leader in lithium production, we expect to be an example and help define the standards of sustainability in this market as it goes through this fundamental shift.
Now turning to Slide 7 and more on the lithium market outlook.
Based on our current market data, EV trends, and regular interactions with our customers, we are revising our lithium demand outlook upwards once again.
We now expect 2025 lithium demand of approximately 1.5 million tons, up more than 30% from our previous estimates.
Beyond 2025, we anticipate continued growth with lithium demand of more than 3 million tons by 2030.
EV sales growth is accelerating as consumers become more energy-conscious, governments incentivize clean energy, technology improves, and EVs approach pricing parity with internal combustion vehicles.
In 2021, global EV production nearly doubled to over 6 million vehicles from 3 million in 2020.
By the end of the decade, EVs are expected to account for close to 40% of automotive sales.
When you look at last year's growth rate of nearly 50% and the auto industry's ambitions for a rapid transition to EVs, it's easy to see why demand expectations are so bullish.
However, meeting this demand will be a challenge.
Turning to our wave two projects on Slide 8.
La Negra 3 and 4, which will add conversion capacity for our Chilean brine resource in the Salar de Atacama, is currently in the customer qualification process.
We anticipate incremental volumes and revenue contribution from this project in the second quarter of this year.
While there are significant changes taking place to the political landscape in Chile, we do not anticipate any material impacts to our business.
We support the Chilean people's right of self-determination and applaud the peaceful leadership transition in that country.
Our team has already begun building relationships with the incoming administration.
As I mentioned earlier, Kemerton 1 reached mechanical completion late last year and is currently in the commissioning phase.
This puts us on track to begin first sales in the second half of this year.
Kemerton 2 remains on track to reach mechanical completion by the end of this year.
The OEMs and battery manufacturers have been investing heavily in growth, including commitments in North America and Europe, and the lithium industry must do the same.
Turning to Slide 9.
We provide an overview of how Albemarle is investing to support downstream growth.
Since our Investor Day, we have accelerated and further defined our wave three projects, including the announcement of three strategic investments in China.
This wave of investments will provide Albemarle with approximately 200,000 tons of additional capacity.
That's up from 150,000 tons of capacity originally planned for wave three.
We've also continued to progress our growth options for wave four.
Based on discussions with our customers, we are analyzing options to restart our Kings Mountain lithium mine and the potential to build conversion assets in North America and Europe.
Our vertical integration, access to high-quality, low-cost resources, years of experience bringing conversion capacity online, and strong balance sheet provide us with considerable advantages.
I'm on Slide 10 now.
In China, we expect to close the acquisition of the Qinzhou conversion facility in the first half of this year.
This transaction is progressing well, and we continue to work through the appropriate regulatory reviews.
The Qinzhou plant is currently being commissioned, and we have begun tolling our spodumene to assist with that process.
We continue to progress the two greenfield lithium conversion projects in Meishan and Zhangjiagang.
We have started site clearing at Meishan and expect to break ground at Zhangjiagang later this year.
We expect mechanical completion of both projects by the end of 2024.
The restart of one of three processing lines at the Wodgina mine is going well, with first spodumene concentrate production now expected in the second quarter.
At Greenbushes, Talison continues to ramp production from the CGP 2 facility to meet design throughput and recovery rates.
In addition, the tailings project at Talison is on track.
Our bromine business is investing in innovation and capital projects to take advantage of growth opportunities.
We expect new products to make up more than 10% of annual bromine revenues by 2025, up from essentially a standing start.
The first of these products to launch is SAYTEX ALERO, our next-generation polymeric flame retardant.
We first discussed SAYTEX ALERO at our Investor Day last year, and I'm excited to say that we have achieved first commercial sales in January and expect to scale production throughout the year.
We've also invested in the resource expansion at the Smackover formation in Arkansas, and we continue to grow our conversion and derivative capacity in both Arkansas and Jordan.
Scott, you might be on mute.
Can you hear me now?
I was on mute.
I'll begin on Slide 12.
For the fourth quarter, we generated net sales of $894 million, which is an increase of $15 million compared to the prior-year quarter.
This was driven by higher sales from lithium and bromine, partially offset by the loss of revenue from our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in June 2021.
Excluding FCS, we grew by 11%.
The fourth-quarter net loss attributable to Albemarle was $4 million, reflecting an increased cost estimate to construct our Kemerton lithium hydroxide plant due to anticipated cost overruns from the impact of pandemic-related issues on the supply chain and labor.
Fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.01 was down 14% from the prior year.
The primary adjustment to earnings per share is the $1.13 add-back of that Kemerton revision.
Excluding FCS, fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was up 12% from the prior year.
Lithium results remained strong driven by higher volumes as well as higher pricing.
Bromine results were roughly flat year over year, reflecting strong performance in late 2020 and repeating it in 2021.
And Catalyst improved in the fourth quarter as refinery markets continue to rebound and the business saw benefits from onetime items.
Our second-half sales grew 13% from the first half of the year, following a relatively flat growth since mid-2020.
This acceleration of growth is expected to continue into 2022.
On Slide 14, you can see we are expecting both volume and pricing growth in all three of our business units in 2022.
We expect net sales of between $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.3 billion.
This implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 27% and 29%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share and net cash from operations are also expected to improve year over year.
We anticipate healthy growth in adjusted EBITDA in all four quarters this year, and we expect Q1 to be the strongest quarter for several reasons.
All three GBUs are expected to benefit from lower-cost inventory sold at prices that have been raised in anticipation of inflation.
In the first quarter, lithium also has the benefit of strong shipments from our Talison joint venture to our partner as well as a onetime spodumene sales material produced at Wodgina on initial start-up in 2019.
And finally, going forward, higher spodumene transfer pricing increases are going to increase our cost of sales and only partially be offset by higher Talison joint venture income, which is included in our EBITDA after tax.
And this creates a tax-impacted EBITDA margin drive.
As Kent mentioned, capex is expected to increase to the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range this year as we accelerate lithium investments to meet increased customer demand.
The key actions to meet or exceed this guidance include: first, successful execution of our lithium project start-ups; second, closing the acquisition in China; third, solid performance at our sold-out plants in lithium, bromine, and FCC catalysts; fourth, continued strength in our end-use markets and favorable pricing environment; and lastly, solid procurement to combat inflation.
Lithium's full year 2022 EBITDA is expected to be up 65% to 85%, a significant improvement from our previous outlook.
We now expect volume growth to be up 20% to 30% for the year with the new capacity coming online as well as ongoing efficiency improvements.
Average realized pricing is now expected to increase 40% to 45% compared to 2021 due to strong market pricing as well as the expiration of pricing concessions originally agreed to in late 2019.
In some cases, as these concessions rolled off, pricing reverted to legacy contracts with significantly higher variable pricing.
And as we've been saying, we've also taken the opportunity to work with our strategic customers to renegotiate contracts to more variable-rate structures.
Catalyst EBITDA is expected to be up 5% to 15%.
This is below our previous outlook, primarily due to cost pressures related to high natural gas pricing in Europe and raw material inflation.
Volumes are expected to grow across segments with overall refining markets improving.
We continue to see volumes returning to pre-pandemic levels in late 2022 or 2023.
FCC volumes are already there, but HPC volumes are lagging.
Bromine EBITDA is expected to be up 5% to 10%, slightly above our previous outlook based on strong flame retardant demand supported by macro trends, such as digitalization and electrification.
Volumes are expected to increase based on the expansions we began in 2021.
And as discussed, higher pricing and ongoing cost and efficiency improvements are expected to offset higher freight and raw material costs.
Now turning to Slide 16, I'll provide some additional color on lithium volume growth.
This slide shows the expected lithium production volume ramp from the new conversion facilities we expect to complete this year.
We begin the year with a baseload production of 88,000 metric tons in 2021, which includes Silver Peak, Kings Mountain, Xinyu, Chengdu, and La Negra 1 and 2.
And you can see that this is virtually a 50-50 split of carbonate and hydroxide.
As our wave two projects come online, output will begin to favor hydroxide.
Generally speaking, we expect it to take about two years to ramp to full conversion capacity at a new plant, including approximately six months for commissioning and qualification.
Therefore, we expect to reach our full 200,000 tons of conversion production by early 2025.
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same.
Our primary focus is to invest in profitable growth opportunities, particularly for lithium and bromine.
Strategic portfolio management and maintaining financial flexibility are important levers to support this growth.
For example, we have divested non-core businesses like FCS and reallocated funds to organic/inorganic growth opportunities, like the expected acquisition of the Qinzhou plant.
The strategic review of Catalyst is progressing well and is on track for us to make an announcement of the outcome in the first half of this year.
We'll also continue to evaluate bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate growth or bolster our portfolio of top-tier assets.
As always, future dividends and share repurchases are subject to board approval.
However, we expect to continue to support our dividend.
Given the outsized growth opportunities we see in lithium, we don't anticipate share repurchases in the foreseeable future.
First, we will continue to grow profitably.
This means completing our wave two expansions and progressing wave three expansions to grow lithium conversion capacity and volumes.
We'll also focus on safely and efficiency starting up those facilities.
Next, we will continue to maximize productivity, and this is even more important in today's environment with rising cost for raw materials.
We will leverage our operational discipline to offset inflation through manufacturing excellence, implementing lean principles, and embracing smart technology to improve HSE, cost, reliability, and quality.
Our procurement cost-saving initiatives and manufacturing excellence projects will be key to offsetting higher raw materials and freight cost as we work to achieve adjusted EBITDA margin of between 27% and 29%.
We will invest with discipline.
As Scott discussed, portfolio management and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating are both high priority for us and will continue to be a focus in 2022.
Importantly, we plan to complete the catalyst strategic review later this year, which will maximize value and set that business up for success while enabling us to focus on growth.
Finally, we will advance sustainability.
That means driving progress toward our goals for greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater use and setting additional sustainability targets.
We'll also continue to work with our customers to improve the sustainability of the lithium supply chain by completing our mine site certifications, Scope 3 greenhouse gas assessments, and analyzing product life cycles.
