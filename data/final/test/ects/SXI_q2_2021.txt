I will then review our segment performance and outlook.
Ademir will follow with a discussion of our consolidated results and financial position.
Finally, I will conclude with comments on the longer-term financial framework we are introducing today and conclude with takeaways.
We're very pleased with our fiscal second quarter results.
We had solid revenue growth at Electronics and Scientific segments year-on-year, while our Engraving segment margin improved sequentially.
At Electronics nearly half of the 31% year-on-year revenue increase reflected organic growth with positive trends in electric vehicles, general automotive, appliances and semiconductor equipment.
Scientific revenue continued to grow at a double-digit rate with a 16% year-on-year increase driven by strong demand for COVID vaccine storage.
We now believe that COVID related storage demand is likely to be at the higher end of our previously indicated $10 million to $20 million range in fiscal 2021.
At the Engraving segment, margin improved approximately 100 basis points sequentially due to favorable geographic mix, productivity and cost actions.
Looking forward, our portfolio has never been in better condition and that's reflected in our outlook.
We exited the second quarter with several positive trends positioning us well for a stronger second half and fiscal 2021.
Our total backlog realizable under one year was approximately $173 million at the end of the second quarter and approximately 14% sequential increase.
This reflected strength in the Electronics and Scientific segments and a gradual market recovery at Specialty Solutions.
We are also actively engaged with our customers on emerging global opportunities in end markets such as electric vehicles, renewable energy and 5G.
In addition, the integration of Renco Electronics is ahead of our initial plan and we are effectively leveraging its complementary customer base and end markets.
We also saw continued progress on our productivity and finance initiatives.
We are on track for over $7 million in annual savings in fiscal 2021 from cost actions and are implementing additional productivity and efficiency initiatives, which will provide further opportunity heading into fiscal 2022.
At the Electronics segment while we are addressing rhodium material inflation with price actions in the near term, we are also implementing new manufacturing processes over the next two years, which will allow us to offer customers a choice of switches with rhodium or other materials removing our exposure to rhodium inflation once and for all.
Finally, our previously announced interest expense and tax rate initiatives resulted in an approximate 15% reduction in interest expense and 510 basis point reduction in tax rate year-on-year in the second quarter fiscal 2021.
We also further strengthened our financial profile in the quarter providing significant flexibility to pursue our portfolio of organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
We generated strong free cash flow of $17 million in the second quarter and through the first half of fiscal 2021 have achieved 95% free cash flow to net income conversion rate.
During the quarter we also repatriated approximately $17 million from foreign subsidiaries and are on track to achieve our previously announced $35 million repatriation target in fiscal 2021.
We ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.9 times, and approximately $200 million in available liquidity.
In regard to our fiscal third quarter 2021 outlook, we expect a moderate sequential revenue and operating margin improvement compared to fiscal second quarter 2021 results.
This reflects a sequential revenue increase at Electronics, Scientific, Engineering Technologies and Specialty Solutions segments.
Engraving revenue is expected to decline sequentially reflecting both geographic mix and timing of projects, but return to growth in fiscal fourth quarter 2021 both sequentially and year-on-year.
I will begin to discuss our segment financial performance starting with Electronics.
In the second quarter Electronics segment revenue increased approximately $14.3 million or 31.2% year-on-year to $60.1 million, supported by organic revenue growth of approximately 15%.
Organic growth reflected a broad based geographical recovery with positive trends in electric vehicles, general automotive, appliances and semiconductor equipment end markets.
In particular, as shown in the picture on Slide 4, we have a growing portfolio of content for the electric vehicle market including relays, planar transformers and coolant level and charging position sensors.
The recent Renco acquisition also contributed to our revenue growth in the quarter with approximately $6 million in incremental revenue contribution year-on-year.
Electronics operating income increased approximately $2.2 million or 28.1% year-on-year from operating leverage associated with revenue growth, productivity initiatives and profit contribution from Renco, partially offset by increased raw material prices.
Our new business opportunity funnel has increased to $56 million across a broad range of markets and is expected to deliver $12 million of incremental sales in fiscal 2021.
Sequentially in the third quarter, we expect a moderate increase in Electronics revenue and operating margin.
We expect further growth for relays in renewable energy and electric vehicle applications as well as recovery in reed switch demand in transportation end markets.
Our near-term backlog is very healthy with backlog realizable under a year increasing $15 million or 25% sequentially in the fiscal second quarter.
Revenue decreased just under 1% year-over-year to approximately $37.9 million and operating income was $6.5 million or a 6% year-over-year decrease.
The results reflected the economic impact of COVID-19 on our end markets, partially mitigated by productivity and expense savings in the quarter.
Sequentially, revenue increased 2.5% excluding foreign exchange and operating margin improved approximately 100 basis points to 17.1%, reflecting favorable geographic mix and our productivity and cost actions.
Laneway sales increased approximately 9% sequentially to $12.9 million focused around soft trim tools, laser engraving and tool finishing.
As highlighted to the left, we have further innovated our customer design process given the global travel restrictions due to the pandemic.
Intensive customer collaboration is at the heart of the customer intimacy model in all of our businesses and was slowed by COVID-related restrictions.
By utilizing high-definition cameras and 3D software, we have created a remote approval process to enable customer engagement and design approvals despite global travel restrictions, allowing us to further the design process while maintaining a high degree of client engagement.
Sequentially in our third fiscal quarter, we expect a slight revenue decline and a moderate decline in operating margin at Engraving, reflecting geographic mix and project timing.
In our fiscal fourth quarter 2021, we expect an increase in revenue and operating margin sequentially and year-on-year.
Turning to Slide 6 and Scientific segment.
Scientific segment revenue increased 16.1% year-on-year to $17.9 million largely due to positive trends at retail pharmaceutical chains and medical distribution companies, much of it associated with the demand for COVID vaccine storage.
Operating income increased 4.4% year-on-year to $4.2 million reflecting the volume increase balanced with investments to support our growth opportunities.
Sequentially in the fiscal third quarter, we expect a moderate to strong increase in revenue and operating margin to be slightly ahead of second fiscal quarter 2021.
This reflects volume growth driven by continued COVID-19 vaccine storage demand balanced with reinvestment in the business for R&D and growth opportunities.
The segment's backlog realizable under a year increased approximately $4 million or 65% sequentially compared to fiscal first quarter 2021.
We expect COVID vaccine storage demand to come in at the high end of our previously indicated $10 million to $20 million sales range in fiscal 2021.
Turning to the Engineering Technologies segment on Slide 7.
On a year-over-year basis, Engineering Technologies revenue and operating income decreased approximately 33.9% and 60.2% to $17.5 million and $1.4 million respectively.
As expected, the revenue and operating income decrease reflected the economic impact of COVID-19 on the commercial aviation market, especially engine parts manufacturing.
On a sequential basis, segment operating margin increased approximately 500 basis points on a similar revenue level to fiscal first quarter 2021 as a result of product mix and our ongoing productivity actions.
Besides the early stages of recovery in our aviation end markets that we are seeing, we are also well positioned for continued space end market growth.
In addition to projected government launch forecasts to support NASA and national security, we also have significant opportunities in commercial space markets.
In the fiscal third quarter on a sequential basis, we expect a moderate increase in revenue, primarily due to the early stages of recovery in the commercial aviation end market.
We expect operating margin to be sequentially similar to the second quarter due to higher sales mix of lower margin engine parts business, partially offset by productivity initiatives.
On a year-over-year basis, Specialty Solutions revenue decreased approximately 17.8% to $22.8 million and operating income of $3.2 million or a 26% year-on-year decrease.
As expected, the revenue and operating income decline reflected the economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic on this segment's end markets.
Sequentially, in our fiscal third quarter, we expect a moderate sequential increase in revenue and operating margin reflecting a gradual recovery in the foodservice industry and strong order trends in the refuse markets.
Supporting this outlook, our backlog realizable under a year increased sequentially approximately $3.5 million for 35% compared to Q1 fiscal 2021, reflecting ongoing recovery in food service equipment and refuse end markets.
From a strategy standpoint, our emphasis on shifting hydraulics manufacturing capacity toward higher-margin aftermarket opportunities continues with aftermarket revenue increasing 15% year-on-year.
The hydraulics business is also a potential beneficiary from a potential infrastructure bill with increased investment in roads and bridges.
First, I will provide a few key financial takeaways from our fiscal second quarter 2021 results.
We realized sequential improvement on several fronts during the quarter.
First revenue increased at our Electronics, Engraving and Scientific segments and we expect revenue growth to continue in the third quarter in four out of our five reporting segments.
From a margin standpoint adjusted EBIT margin also improved sequentially reflecting revenue growth, the impact of our cost efficiency and productivity actions, partially offset by continued rising raw material costs, primarily at our Electronics segment.
We continue to focus our efforts on productivity actions and are on track to realize savings of over $7 million in fiscal '21 related to our previously announced cost actions.
In addition, we further strengthened our financial profile through initiatives focused on free cash flow generation, reduced interest expense and tax rate and continued cash repatriation.
We also generated approximately $17 million of free cash flow in the second quarter.
We had approximately 95% free cash flow to net income conversion rate to the first half of fiscal 2021.
On a consolidated basis, total revenue increased 1.7% year-on-year and 3.3% sequentially.
Year-on-year revenue increase reflected contribution from our recent Renco acquisition and foreign exchange, partially offset by the economic impact of COVID-19.
Organic revenue declined 4.3% year-on-year, much of it due to the impact of the pandemic.
As we expected COVID-19 economic impact was most evident at the Engineering Technologies segment due to weakness in the aviation end market and the Specialty Solutions segment to weakness in the food service equipment and hospitality industries.
Our recent Renco acquisition and foreign exchange impact offset the organic revenue decline.
Renco contributed approximately $6 million to revenue or 3.9% offset to the organic revenue decline on a consolidated basis.
In addition, FX contributed a 2% increase to year-on-year revenue growth.
On year-on-year basis our adjusted EBIT margin declined by 60 basis points to 11.4%.
This decline was primarily due to the economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic, increased raw material cost and increases in research and development initiatives offset by cost and productivity actions.
On a sequential basis adjusted EBIT margin increased 40 basis points.
Interest expense decreased approximately 17% year-on-year primarily due to lower overall interest rate as a result of the previously implemented variable to fixed rate swaps.
In addition, our tax rate of 20.9% in the second quarter of 2021 was largely due to various tax optimization strategies we began to implement earlier in the fiscal year.
For fiscal 2021 we continue to expect approximately 22% tax rate.
This assumes a tax rate in the mid 20% range in the third quarter and a tax rate in the low 20% range in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Adjusted earnings per share was a $1.05 in the second quarter of '21 compared to $0.99 a year ago.
We continue to consistently generate free cash flow with a conversion to net income of over 140% in the second quarter of '21.
We reported free cash flow of $17 million inclusive of $4.8 million pension payment, compared to $3.6 million a year ago.
This free cash flow increase reflected solid working capital performance as we deleveraged the balance sheet by approximately $9 million in the quarter.
Standex had net debt of $90.9 million at the end of December, compared to $106.2 million at the end of September.
Net debt for the second quarter of '21 consisted primarily of long-term debt of $200 million and cash and equivalents of approximately $109 million with approximately $80 million held by foreign subs.
Our financial strength was evident in several of our key metrics.
Standex net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 0.9 at the end of the second quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of 15.4%.
The Company's interest coverage ratio increased sequentially to approximately 10.3 times.
We had approximately $200 million of available liquidity at the end of the second quarter and continued to repatriate cash with approximately $17 million repatriated during the quarter.
We remain on plan to repatriate approximately $35 million in fiscal '21.
From a capital allocation perspective, we repurchased approximately 36,000 shares for $2.5 million.
There is approximately $35 million left remaining on our current repurchase authorization.
We also declared our 226th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on January 28 of $0.24.
Finally, we continue to expect fiscal 2021 capital expenditures to be between approximately $25 million to $28 million.
Over the past few years we have meaningfully transformed our portfolio around high-quality businesses with attractive growth and margin profiles as well as strong end markets and customer value propositions.
As a result of these substantial changes, our portfolio has never been in a better position.
We believe it is now appropriate to provide a longer term, that is three to five-year, financial outlook.
Specifically, we are targeting mid-single digit consolidated organic revenue growth on a compound annual basis.
Our outlook assumes a continued macroeconomic recovery.
Our businesses are well positioned to grow in exciting areas such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, smart grid, space commercialization, vaccine storage and 5G.
We also have an active new product development process for our business, particularly in Electronics, Scientific and Engraving segments.
We are targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin in excess of 20% compared to the 16.4% we reported in fiscal 2020.
A few productivity initiatives to highlight include improving our Electronics cost position by implementing new manufacturing processes to address rising raw material prices, ongoing operational excellence actions to further standardize operating discipline across business units and continuing to fully leverage our G&A structure.
We believe a free cash flow conversion ratio of 100% is achievable under these assumptions, particularly, given our continued working capital focus.
Finally, it is our expectation that with this financial performance and disciplined capital allocation, we will increase our return on invested capital to above 12%.
We will continue to exercise discipline in our capital allocation process as illustrated in this page.
We have recently increased our hurdle for internal growth investments to over 20% IRR.
In addition, we will continue to buy back our shares on an opportunistic basis.
We expect a moderate revenue and operating margin improvement in fiscal third quarter 2021 compared to fiscal second quarter 2021 results and are well positioned for a stronger second half fiscal 2021.
We also provided a longer-term financial outlook today reflecting our meaningfully transformed portfolio focused around businesses with attractive growth and margin profiles as well as strong end market and customer value propositions.
Our substantial financial flexibility allows us to be opportunistic with an active pipeline of organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
Our ongoing productivity and efficiency initiatives provide further opportunity to leverage these trends for improved financial performance.
