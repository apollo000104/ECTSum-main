Today, we'll discuss the financial performance of KAR Global for the quarter ended September 30th 2021.
After concluding our commentary, we will take questions from participants.
Let me also mention that throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
I'll provide an update on the commercial seller volumes and what we expect to see between now and the end of next year.
I'll also provide updates on the continued growth in our dealer-to-dealer business with a focus on our digital dealer-to-dealer businesses, BacklotCars and TradeRev.
I'll provide an update on our acquisition of Carwave and the solid performance of our finance business, AFC.
And I'll close out with some updates relating to our cost structure.
So, I'd like to start with the third quarter.
And there is no question but that the third quarter was a challenging quarter, and the challenges were volume related and principally tied to the commercial seller category, specifically to off-lease vehicles.
These industrywide volume challenges are tied to the disruption of new vehicle production, and I spoke to these dynamics in detail at our Analyst Day event back in September.
However, I will say that the situation remains largely as I described at that time.
So in the third quarter, despite operating in an environment of very constrained vehicle supply from commercial sellers, we achieved the following results.
For KAR overall, we generated $535 million in revenue, which was a decline of 10% from Q3 of last year.
We generated a total gross profit of $222 million, representing 50.1% of revenue, excluding purchased vehicles.
We generated $96.6 million in adjusted EBITDA.
Cash generated from operations for the quarter was $57 million.
Within the ADESA segment, we facilitated the sale of 586,000 vehicles, representing over $9 billion in gross auction proceeds.
Now, these volumes are down 33% versus Q3 of last year.
Within that, our total commercial volume was down by 51% versus Q3 of last year and our total dealer consigned volume actually increased by 20%.
51% of our sales in the third quarter was from off-premise locations, and this is similar to our experience in the first half of this year.
We sold 118,000 vehicles on the TradeRev and BacklotCars platforms on a combined basis.
We also set new records in terms of total active sellers and total active buyers on these digital dealer-to-dealer platforms in both the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter.
We generated $274 in gross profit per vehicle sold in the ADESA segment.
This was driven in part by strong auction revenue per vehicle sold and is higher than the gross profit per vehicle generated in the first half of this year and 10% greater than the same statistic from Q3 of last year.
SG&A for KAR overall was $134 million for the quarter and SG&A for the ADESA segment was $126 million and that was down $14 million from Q1 of this year.
I continue to be pleased with the performance of our AFC business segment.
AFC had 351,000 loan transactions in the quarter.
This was an increase of 8% versus the same quarter last year and it was in line with the levels that we'd expect.
Revenue per loan transaction was also higher, 20% higher than Q3 of last year, at $215 for the quarter.
Key drivers of this were higher vehicle values and lower credit losses.
AFC continues to experience lower-than-normal levels of risk, driven by the current market conditions combined with strong operations.
AFC continues to grow its volume of business, as well as reengineered business processes to have a more efficient service delivery.
And for all those reasons, I expect to see continued strong performance from AFC, given the current environment.
So, I'd like to speak for a few moments about the supply dynamics of used vehicles within our marketplaces, particularly supply from commercial sellers.
So, as I see it, our challenges in the quarter were tied to the lack of commercial seller volumes across our marketplaces.
As I mentioned, commercial seller volumes were down by 51% versus the same quarter last year.
In our last earnings call and subsequently in our Analyst Day, I went into quite a lot of detail on the drivers of commercial vehicle supply within our industry.
My fundamental assessment has not changed.
I do believe that we're at the bottom in terms of the disruption with the supply of off-lease vehicles and rental vehicles at physical auctions, being very close to zero in both categories.
Most meaningful to KAR is the disruption in the off-lease volumes, which historically have represented approximately 60% of our total commercial seller volumes.
Now, volumes of repossessed vehicles also remain below normal.
I would say that repossession volumes are relatively stable at about 70% of normal levels right now.
And our analysis of the quarter's results indicate that we have maintained our market share with commercial sellers in the quarter.
So while we may be at the bottom, I still believe we should expect to remain here for some time.
In order for the volumes in our marketplaces to increase, we need to see an increase in new vehicle production, sufficient to reduce the very high used vehicle values and allow more off-lease vehicles to flow into the wholesale channel.
In our Analyst Day, we said that we expected new vehicle production to start to improve toward the end of the first half of next year and to continue to improve in the second half, but that we expected it to remain below normal throughout 2022.
Based on our continued analysis, as well as our ongoing conversations with customers, that assessment has not changed.
What that implies for our business is that we expect the current commercial seller volume constraints to continue through the first half of next year and we expect to see a small improvement in the second half.
We expect to see an acceleration in the volume recovery in 2023 and beyond.
So now, I'd like to provide an update on our progress in the dealer-to-dealer vehicle category.
So first of all, if we look at our total dealer consignment volumes at KAR, and by which I mean digital and physical combined, we sold 274,000 dealer consigned vehicles in the third quarter.
That represented an increase of 20% compared to KAR's total dealer volume in Q3 of last year.
Some of that increase is driven by the acquisition of BacklotCars, but I'm pleased that we were able to increase our overall volume by 20%, given the tight supply dynamics that exist across our industry.
If we look at the digital dealer-to-dealer category only, our Q3 volume of 118,000 -- was 118,000 vehicle sold.
The comparable metric for Q3 of last year was 58,000.
So, we grew our total digital dealer-to-dealer volume by 105%.
However, BacklotCars was not part of KAR in Q3 of last year.
And if we include BacklotCars in last year's number, the growth is approximately 19%.
We saw record numbers of participating sellers and buyers on our digital dealer-to-dealer platforms in both the U.S. and Canada in Q3.
We also saw continued growth in average vehicle value sold on both TradeRev in Canada and BacklotCars in the U.S. And finally, in Canada, our TradeRev business continued to perform very well, delivering strong volumes in the second consecutive quarter of solid profitability.
I'd like to spend a few moments on the acquisition of Carwave.
We closed on the acquisition of Carwave in early October.
So, our Q3 volumes do not reflect any volume from Carwave.
The Carwave acquisition has approximately 100,000 vehicles sold per annum.
Carwave originated in California and is the leading platform for dealers in that market.
California, as you might imagine, is a large automotive market.
If we look at new vehicle registrations statistics, there are more new vehicle registrations in California each year than in the smallest 20 states combined.
Also, California has almost as many new vehicle registrations as the next two largest markets, which are Texas and Florida, combined.
It's in our diligence that Carwave platform delivers excellent performance for the sellers and buyers.
The average vehicle value sold on Carwave is higher than that sold on BacklotCars, and it also generates a higher revenue per vehicle sold and is profitable.
And of course, the acquisition of Carwave also brings a strong team.
I believe the acquisition strengthens our map and increases the network effect for digital dealer-to-dealer business in the U.S. Carwave's strength out West and BacklotCars's strength in the middle of the United States means that we now have a stronger footprint than ever before in terms of both geography and depths within any given market.
Ultimately, we see an opportunity to combine those two businesses, bringing the best of both and creating an ever more powerful offering for sellers and the buyers.
We also see an opportunity to continue to move up market and sell a larger number of higher value vehicles.
This in turn will help drive further increases in revenue per unit sold and stronger margins.
So, our integration planning is ongoing.
But ultimately, we envision a single solution in the market; a solution that aligns with the needs and preferences of our dealers and that leverages the best technology, features, functionality and economic model of both platforms.
Now, given the strength of both businesses and the positive momentum that both businesses have, we would likely take a little longer to execute this than was the case with the TradeRev migration.
We want to make sure that we don't disrupt our customers and that to the extent we make changes, we're delivering an experience that is better than before for all of our customers.
And finally, the addition of Carwave means that our current run rate with digital dealer-to-dealer transactions is now very close to 600,000 vehicles sold per annum and continuing to grow.
So, we are well on our way toward achieving the target that I established in -- on our Analyst Day of 1.2 million digital dealer-to-dealer transactions annually by 2025.
So, I'd like to spend a few moments talking about our cost structure.
On recent earnings calls and, again, on the Analyst Day event, we've discussed our strategic focus on reducing our cost structure to reflect our transition to a more digital marketplace.
The reality of lower-than-normal commercial seller volumes likely persisting through much of 2022 means that our continued focus on cost remains a top priority for me and for the management team.
So, I'd like to provide an update on that.
During this last quarter, we initiated a project into prioritizing and accelerating key areas for growth while refining our operating model toward a more digital future and also to address the lower-than-normal commercial seller volumes that we are currently experiencing.
We've committed significant resources toward that initiative and there are four principal work streets.
I referred to these in our Analyst Day, but to recap them here, they're are as follows.
Our sales and go-to-market opportunities, the evolution of our service operations, our technology investments and the overall management of our SG&A.
So, I believe we've made very good progress on this project and we're now nearing the end of the assessment phase.
In fact, it will be completed within the next couple of weeks.
Now, I expect that you will be all interested to know the scale and the timing of all this.
Rather than committing to a number before I have the full report, I'd like to allow our team the opportunity to complete their work and I look forward to providing more in-depth assessment on our future call.
However, I am comfortable enough with the preliminary analysis to report the following.
First, in terms of the sizing of these opportunities.
Our Analyst Day materials pointed to an SG&A opportunity of $30 million.
I'm confident that our SG&A opportunity will be at least that amount.
However, SG&A is just one part of the mix.
We're also looking at opportunities to reduce our direct costs.
I believe that we have opportunities to do so and that these will be in addition to that number.
And finally, we're also looking at opportunities to improve revenue and improve the monetization of our services, while also accelerating growth in key areas.
These will be an important part of the overall target as well.
In terms of the timing.
First of all, I want to be clear that what I'm describing here are not short-term or temporary cost cuts.
What we're looking at are permanent changes in our operating model and our cost structure, reengineering the way we do business and ultimately, reducing our cost to serve over the long term.
I don't expect to see an impact from this in the current quarter, but I do expect to see positive impacts in 2022 and in all of the years following from that.
And finally, in terms of our strategy to manage and communicate these initiatives, we will be setting specific goals and there will be a clear process in place to measure the impacts to make sure we stay on track.
And of course, I expect myself and the management teams to be held accountable to those.
So, I look forward to providing greater detail and more precise metrics in a future call.
My last point is to make a few remarks on our expectations for the current quarter.
As discussed in September, it is difficult to predict the supply of vehicles in the wholesale market at this time.
We withdrew our guidance in September and I'm not providing guidance until our visibility into volume improves.
With that said, we typically experienced some seasonal impacts in the fourth quarter and I would expect that our fourth quarter performance, by which I'm referring to adjusted EBITDA, will be less than our Q3 levels.
So to summarize my key messages from today, clearly, the commercial volume challenges continue.
I believe that we're at the bottom now, but I think the volume challenges will continue well into next year.
However, I also expect we will see some improvement before the end of next year.
My longer-term view has not changed.
I believe that the outlook for off-lease, repossessed and rental vehicles will be one of increasing volume over time, ultimately returning to historical levels.
The recovery will take time, but it's clear to me that we should be a strong beneficiary of this when it happens.
In terms of dealer-to-dealer, we are growing our volume with our combined digital and physical volume up 20% versus the same quarter last year.
In terms of our digital dealer-to-dealer platform, we delivered solid growth in transactions and we had a record quarter in terms of marketplace participation in both the U.S. and Canada.
The addition of Carwave means that we're now at an annual run rate of close to 600,000 vehicles sold per annum and growing.
I'm pleased that despite lower volumes, we were able to deliver our best quarter yet in terms of gross profit per vehicle sold.
We also saw solid profitability for TradeRev in Canada and a strong performance at AFC.
Notwithstanding the growth levers that exist for us, we continue to be very focused on costs.
We have initiated a significant initiative, and we are committed to following through with it.
We look forward to providing more updates going forward.
Sanjeev became an observer on our Board through Periphas Capital's participation in our 2020 pipe transaction, and he previously served on our Board from 2007 to 2013.
You can read more about Sanjeev's background in our 8-K.
We are very fortunate to have his deep industry knowledge and his strategic mindset on our Board, and I'm confident he will continue to be a vocal advocate for KAR Global and for our stockholders.
So with that, Eric will now provide a more detailed review of our financial results for the quarter.
I have a few things to add to Peter's commentary today.
First, I would like to point out some bright spots in the current situation we are facing.
We all know that the supply of wholesale vehicles is constrained primarily for our commercial vehicle business.
However, this has led to strong used car pricing.
Gross auction proceeds are at record levels in all segments of our business.
The average selling price in our commercial off-premise segment primarily openly was $21,500 in the third quarter compared to $19,400 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2020.
Digital dealer-to-dealer representing BacklotCars and TradeRev had an average sale price of $10,400 in Q3 compared to $8,900 last year.
And our on-premise auctions, which includes a mix of commercial and dealer consignment, had an average selling price of $15,000 per vehicle compared to $13,300 one year ago.
This strong pricing situation has led to higher option fees per transaction across all of our marketplaces.
The only marketplace that has been -- has seen a significant decline in fees is the OPENLANE private-label programs.
The high percentage of transactions being grounding dealer purchases caused auction fees per transaction on this platform to decline 20% year-over-year in the third quarter.
Another positive in the third quarter was the gross profit per vehicle in the ADESA segment, achieving $274 gross profit per car sold in Q3 compared to $249 in the prior year, and this was a strong performance.
This reflects a positive mix of revenue with more of our revenue coming from higher margin auction services than other lower-margin services.
The lack of commercial supply, especially off-lease vehicles, reduces revenue from lower margin services like transportation and end-of-lease inspections.
I want to be clear though.
While we are very focused on improving our cost structure and increasing gross profit per unit over historical levels, our business prospers when there are more transactions, even if gross profit per unit were lower than $274.
The third quarter did benefit from royalty revenue received from Insurance Auto Auctions based on the number of non-insurance vehicles sold by IAA over the previous 12 months.
And a positive in Q3 was performance at AFC.
Consistent with the growth in volume in the dealer-to-dealer channel at ADESA, AFC saw an increase in the number of loan transactions, 8%; an increase in revenue per loan transaction, 20%; and an increase in adjusted EBITDA, 63%.
The AFC segment was able to improve all of its key performance metrics and reduced SG&A as compared to last year.
While the current supply situation has put pressure on the wholesale used car remarketing industry, these same factors have made floorplan lending perform at very high levels of profitability.
Average loan values are increasing due to higher used car prices.
Low used car inventories at retailers means faster turns in our floorplan lending has a majority of its revenue in fees and not interest earnings.
And most importantly, loan losses are at very low levels.
In fact, in the third quarter, recoveries of previously written off loans exceeded the loan losses experienced during the quarter.
As a reminder, our floor plan lending business is collateralized by the vehicles and typically all assets of the dealer principles.
We obtained personal guarantees on substantially all floorplan lines.
When losses are realized, we set judgments for recovery of the losses when assets, including real estate, are monetized by the dealer principles.
We are currently benefiting from the strong real estate market and high real estate values.
This allows us to recover past losses.
Most recoveries are losses that occurred one to three years prior to the actual recovery.
Now despite the positives in our performance that I have highlighted, our overall performance was still challenging due to the low number of transactions completed.
As Peter pointed out, the pressure is on our commercial volumes as we have begun to see year-over-year growth in our dealer-to-dealer volumes due to the strong growth in digital dealer-to-dealer.
Even though gross profit per unit at ADESA was $274, the gross profit as a percent of revenue, excluding purchased vehicles, declined to 43% in Q3 as compared to the prior year's 49% gross profit.
My first concern is to determine this is not a change in our cost structure going forward.
After analyzing our costs, I have determined that most of the decrease relates to fixed direct costs that just could not be leveraged with the low volumes in Q3.
The largest contributor to the decline in gross profit percent was supervisory labor and facilities costs that is included in cost of services.
We also experienced increased losses on purchased vehicles, primarily inherited vehicles, which are acquired through arbitration activities.
We believe the increased losses were unique to Q3, as we pushed to sell these vehicles quickly to meet customer demand.
The one item that will be a permanent increase in our costs as compared to the last 18 months is the loss of the Canadian employee wage subsidy.
We have been benefiting from the Canadian program since early 2020 and approximately $1.5 million to $4 million of direct cost per quarter going back to the second quarter of 2020 were subsidized in Canada.
Changes in the requirements to receive these subsidies were made effective July 1 2021, and our Canadian business is no longer qualified for the subsidy.
This represents about a 70 bps increase in gross -- increase in cost or decrease in gross profit percent that will be recurring.
I do expect the impact on gross profit to be less though, as volumes begin to increase going forward.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital allocation.
Our total leverage is at 3.2 times adjusted EBITDA.
This has moved above 3 times due to the low performance over the past 12 months.
Our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA is $404 million.
We continue to have a leverage target of three times or less.
Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the acquisition of Carwave.
We funded the $450 million purchase price with cash on hand.
We did not purchase any KAR shares in Q3.
We have $109 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that was set to expire at the end of October.
The Board of Directors has extended our existing share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2022.
We have used a substantial amount of our available cash for the Carwave acquisition and our total net leverage is temporarily above three times.
Even after funding the Carwave acquisition, our cash balances remained strong though.
In times of supply constraint, the free cash conversion of our business generally improves.
That concludes my remarks.
