These are important to review and contemplate.
As everyone on the call today is aware, business environment uncertainty remains heightened due to COVID-19.
These items include shutdown impacts for many areas of the economy, changes to consumer purchasing habits potential for a disruptive supply chain and various other economic factors.
This means that results could change at any time and the forecasted impact of risk consideration to the best estimate based on information available as of today's date.
Additional information concerning risk factors and cautionary statements are available on our most recent SEC filings and the most recent Company 10-K.
I'll now hand it over to our CEO, Ron Lombardi.
And let's start on Slide 5.
Our proven business model continues to set us up for long-term success and the strong earnings performance and a stable topline year-to-date results is continued evidence of this as we have raised our full year revenue and earnings targets.
The business strategy we have in place is a highly adaptable one, which positions us to create value during the pandemic.
Our strategy of offering consumers a wide range of easily accessible brands they know and trust continues to work.
The ongoing objective is to grow categories while connecting with consumers over the long term.
We'll share one example of this long-term strategy, Compound W on the next slide.
Despite the long-term nature of these investments, we are also quick to target near-term opportunities.
This important nuance allows us to adjust our brand-building strategy in real time finding additional ways to deliver brand growth.
For example, as discussed the last two quarters, we have focused on prioritization on where consumers are shopping.
A result of this is that we are winning big in e-commerce where we've seen triple-digit growth and many of our brands actually have a higher share in the channel compared to brick and mortar.
Meanwhile, our nimble business continuity efforts continue to do well during COVID-19.
We continue to work strategically with our manufacturing partners to ensure consistent service levels in this dynamic supply environment.
Finally, our consistent operating model and disciplined capital strategy continue to reward shareholders.
We anticipate solid earnings and free cash flow growth for the full fiscal year, which continues to increase our capital allocation optionality.
So, to recap, our business positioning remain solid and our strategy of delivering consistent results as we close out our fiscal year.
Utilizing our brand-building toolkit and taking time to understand consumer insights, the goal is to drive long-term growth for our leading brands.
Shown on the page we have Compound W, which is a great example of this objective.
It's a brand with a long history with consumers and we've invested steadily behind it through a wide range of tools over time.
One tool used is innovation.
All of our brands operate with a multi-year pipeline of product development concepts to ensure we continue to match the needs of consumers.
Compound W NitroFreeze is a great recent example with its extreme freezing technology that is not found in other OTC treatments.
We are also connecting with consumers, as they think about treatment with content that helps explain their wart treatment options.
For example, during the pandemic, we've reminded consumers of the ability to treat warts effectively at home and the solutions Compound W offers.
The result of our investment behind Compound W is clear.
We have a trusted source for retailers for insights into the wart category and how to drive long-term category growth.
This has enabled our brand to continue to gain shelf space and share.
Our results have been solid.
Over the last five years, Compound W has grown at a double-digit compound annual rate.
That's free outpacing category growth and solidifying its number one market position with consumers as a preferred brand for wart treatment.
With that, I'll now hand it over to Chris to review our financial results.
Q3 revenue of $238.8 million declined 1.6% on an organic basis versus the prior year, which excludes the effects of foreign currency.
By segment, North American revenues were down 2%.
Several segment categories grew with the largest increases in Women's Health and Oral Care.
As expected, however, these gains were offset by lower Cough and Cold as well as motion sickness and head lice as these categories faced declines in incidence levels and usage rates related to changes in consumer behavior due to COVID-19.
Our international segment increased approximately 2% after excluding the effects of foreign currency.
The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of Hydralyte in Australia as certain shelter at home restrictions were lifted related to COVID-19.
As a reminder, due to its distributor model, the timing of international segment orders can be difficult to predict as can the uncertainty around pandemic-related restriction.
Adjusted EBITDA declined approximately 6% in the quarter versus the prior year, primarily driven by the timing of A&M spend.
EBITDA margin remained consistent with our long-term expectations in the mid-30s.
EPS for the quarter was $0.81 per share, flat to the prior year as a result of lower interest expense from debt pay down, offsetting the lower revenue and A&M timing.
For the first nine months revenues were down 90 basis points.
Our diverse portfolio has enabled a stable revenue performance with strength in many brands in our portfolio, helping to offset COVID-19 impacted categories.
Our broad channel diversity continues to help drive revenue performance as we experienced strong triple-digit consumption growth in the e-commerce channel year-to-date, as consumers continue to shift to online purchasing.
Total company gross margin of 58.2% in the first nine months was largely flat to last year's adjusted gross margin of 57.9% and has been stable across quarters.
This was in-line with our expectations and we continue to anticipate a gross margin of about 58% for the remainder of the year.
Advertising and marketing came in at 15.9% of revenue in Q3 and 14.8% for the first nine months.
We still expect A&M for the full year to be you just under 15% as a percent of sales as we continue at a normalized rate of spend in the fourth quarter.
G&A expenses were flat in Q3 down for the first nine months of Fiscal 2021 versus the prior year [Indecipherable] largely to disciplined cost management.
For the full year, we anticipate G&A expenses to approximate 9% of sales and remain below prior year in absolute dollars.
Lastly, we realized strong 15% earnings per share growth for the first nine months of Fiscal 2021 versus the prior year.
Lower operating costs, lower interest expense and lower share count were all factors to the growth.
In the quarter, we generated $43.5 million in free cash flow, which, as expected, was lower than last year due to both timing of working capital and CapEx investments.
For the first nine months of Fiscal 2021, free cash flow of $159.2 million grew over 3% versus the prior year.
We continue to anticipate full year 2021 free cash flow at or above prior year levels.
At the end of Q3, we had approximately $1.5 billion of net debt, which equated to a leverage ratio of 4.2x.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $9 million in shares opportunistically leaving the remainder of our cash generation on the balance sheet in anticipation of a potential bond refinancing event in Q4 to opportunistically capitalize on the attractive debt rate environment.
The cash accumulation was temporary to the quarter.
There has been no change to our strategy of prioritizing debt pay down as our primary use of free cash flow.
With less than two months to go, in our fiscal year, we are confident with our business performance and objectives and are increasing our outlook for both sales and EPS.
For the full year Fiscal 2021, we now anticipate revenues of approximately $935 million.
For Q4, we anticipate consistent trends to what we have realized over the past few quarters.
However, the period will face a unique comparison to the prior year as we experienced a significant lift in March of 2020 as consumers stocked up on items as a result of COVID-19.
We now anticipate adjusted earnings per share of approximately $3.22 for Fiscal 2021.
Disciplined cost management and the benefit of our capital allocation strategy and debt reduction continue to drive a solid earnings growth.
These attributes to translate into free cash flow as well and we continue to anticipate free cash flow of $207 million or more, which is at or above the prior year's level.
We continue to prioritize debt reduction while balancing other disciplined capital allocation efforts to drive shareholder value.
Looking ahead, we continue to have confidence that our business is well-positioned heading into Fiscal 2022.
We will begin to lap the effects of COVID-19 that began in the spring of last year, while our long-term brand building strategy continues to set us up for long-term success.
We continue to target 2% to 3% long-term organic sales growth, which translates into mid to high single-digit earnings growth driven by our stable and solid financial profile and disciplined capital allocation strategy.
It's a proven strategy and we remain confident in its ability to drive value for stakeholders.
