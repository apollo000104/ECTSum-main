We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC.
[Operator Instructions] Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our Virtual 2021 Investor Day meeting scheduled for Friday, September 17, where we will share more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy.
Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics.
We will present our financial results for the second quarter 2021.
We will update our 2021 guidance, and we will summarize the status of our growth initiatives and outlook for the future.
Let me start with the second quarter highlights.
Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.40, with adjusted net income of $199 million and premium revenue of $6.6 billion.
The 88.4% medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related medical cost challenges that increased the ratio by 110 basis points.
The net effect of COVID decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1.
We managed to a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio, reflecting continued discipline in cost management, which allowed us to harvest the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth.
We produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 2.9%, meeting our second quarter expectations.
Our six month year-to-date performance, highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 7% adjusted G&A ratio and a 3.4% after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our year-to-date expectations.
This allowed us to produce, as projected, 60% of our full year earnings guidance in the first half of the year.
And we accomplished all of this as we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue.
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance.
We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continue to drive our growth strategy.
Let me provide some commentary highlighting our second quarter performance.
First, I note that year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year.
The second quarter of last year was the first full quarter of the COVID pandemic and was distorted by the significant positive net effect of COVID that characterized that early phase of the crisis.
In contrast, the current quarter was negatively impacted by the net effect of COVID.
In the second quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.6 billion, a 4% increase over the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our portfolio.
We ended the quarter with approximately 4.7 million members, an increase of 91,000 members over the first quarter of 2021.
Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.9 million members, an increase of 69,000 over the first quarter of 2021.
This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated.
Our Medicare membership was 130,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4,000, and in line with our growth plan.
Our Marketplace membership were 638,000 at the end of the quarter, representing growth of 18,000 over the first quarter of 2021 due to lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the extended open enrollment period.
Turning now to our medical margin performance in the second quarter by line of business.
Our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89%.
While we are dealing with the impacts of the pandemic on utilization and medical cost, as well as the continuing temporary impact of the risk corridors, we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals.
Our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts across all dimensions of the Medicaid product suite is performing well.
We continue to deliver high-quality care at a reasonable cost, particularly to high acuity populations.
The underlying rate environment is stable.
Our hallmark medical management capabilities continue to deliver appropriate clinical outcomes for our members, while achieving strong financial results.
Our Medicare results were excellent, having posted a medical care ratio of 87.6%.
We continue to produce excellent MCRs and margins in this portfolio of high-acuity lives in both our D-SNP product and the MMP programs.
Although our results were moderately depressed due to COVID utilization and despite the temporary risk score softness for the current year, the underlying results were squarely in line with our expectations.
Our Marketplace results have been significantly impacted by direct cost of COVID-related care as we posted a medical care ratio of 84.8% in the quarter.
Many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID, including California, Michigan, Texas and Washington.
With nearly 500 basis points of pressure on the MCR in each of the first two quarters, we can and should achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins as the pandemic subsides.
In short, our second quarter and first half results across the entire portfolio continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic.
Turning to our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue.
For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $25 billion, a 37% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance.
Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the fourth quarter.
Recall, that for each month the public health emergency has extended, beyond the month of September, it increases our full year revenue outlook by $150 million.
Our updated guidance also contemplates the impact from retaining pharmacy-related premium revenue in California, New York and Kentucky due to postponement of, and changes to their respective pharmacy carve-out initiatives, and updated Marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously.
We expect to end 2021 with approximately 590,000 marketplace members.
We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the Affinity and Cigna acquisitions.
We expect the Affinity acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, representing upside to our premium revenue guidance in 2021, and we expect the Cigna acquisition to close in January 2022.
Turning now to earnings guidance.
We are raising our full year 2021 earnings guidance and now expect to end the year with adjusted earnings of no less than $13.25 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of no less than $13 per share.
We remain on track for full year after-tax margins of at least 3%.
Specifically, the increase to our 2021 earnings guidance reflects our underlying outperformance, the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, offset by a $1 increase in the net cost of COVID, which we now expect to be $2.50 per share for the full year.
We have been cautious in projecting our back half earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors.
The delta variant adds variability to any utilization forecast.
While highly contagious, the Delta variant disproportionately affects the unvaccinated.
Older and more vulnerable population cohorts have significantly higher vaccination rates.
As a result, the Delta variant cases result in proportionately fewer hospital admissions and lower per admission costs, moderating the potential impact.
In addition, it remains unknown how quickly and to what extent utilization will return to normal levels.
This will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior, provider capacity and the emergence of any new COVID variants.
There is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new marketplace member acuity levels and their susceptibility to COVID infection and the COVID-related risk-sharing corridors create an added element of variability.
Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives.
We continue to see many actionable opportunities in our acquisition pipeline, which remains an important aspect of our growth strategy.
Our M&A team is fully deployed and is working an active list of health plan targets in our core businesses.
Our acquisition strategy remains focused on buying stable membership and revenue streams, particularly focused on underperforming properties.
Our M&A integration team is also fully deployed and successfully migrating our acquired properties to Molina operating infrastructure and cost structure to ensure we deliver the earnings accretion we expected.
To date, we are on track to meet or exceed our earnings accretion commitments.
We continue to pursue to new Medicaid procurement opportunities.
We have contract winning capabilities, an aggressive in-state ground game and a winning proposal writing platform.
We are confident that we will continue to win new contracts that will contribute to our growth trajectory in 2022 and 2023.
Finally, some comments about the longer-term outlook for our business.
The current rate environment is stable and rational.
We now have confirmed data points to support the continued belief that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors, related to the declared public health emergency, will be eliminated as the COVID pandemic subsides.
Pandemic-related corridors have already been eliminated for the 2022 state fiscal years in California, New York, South Carolina and Michigan, with momentum toward similar outcomes in other states.
The current Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon is temporary as our 2022 bids did fully account for the current assessment of next year's risk scores.
We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses.
The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned, and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly even exceeding them.
In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the incremental embedded earnings power of the business as it exists today is meaningful.
With the increased outlook for the net negative effect of COVID, our incremental embedded earnings power is now more at $5 above our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance.
In short, our pro forma run rate after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints would produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens and an after-tax margin of approximately 4%.
I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Day on September 17.
At our Investor Day, we will provide you with an initial 2022 revenue outlook.
We will also provide you with an updated view of our long-term targets for revenue growth for our three lines of business, operating metrics for our three lines of business and enterprise margin, net income and earnings per share expectations.
And, as importantly, as has been our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving those results.
We will continue not just to declare our goals, but to show you the transparency and specificity how we will achieve them.
Suffice it to say, we are an inherently high-growth businesses and have demonstrated an ability to grow the top line and maintain an attractive margin profile even during a global pandemic.
The political legislative and regulatory environments are all positive catalysts, and the social demographic profile of the U.S. population remains in significant need of the social safety net we manage.
As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues.
Their skill, dedication and steadfast service continue to form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come.
beginning with some detailed commentary about our second quarter results.
The net effect of COVID negatively impacted second quarter results by $77 million or approximately $1 a share.
This increased the second quarter MCR by 110 basis points to 88.4%.
The impact was higher than our expectations and negatively affected all three lines of business.
We experienced high COVID-related inpatient costs early in the quarter, which tapered off as the quarter progressed.
We also saw increases in professional and outpatient costs, which we attribute to what may be the return to normal pre-COVID utilization patterns.
In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $25 million and accounted for a 40 basis point increase that is included within our reported 89% MCR.
The first quarter Medicaid MCR had a 150-basis-point benefit due to COVID, which substantially explains the sequential increase in MCR.
We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s.
In Medicare, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $17 million, increasing the MCR by 200 basis points to 87.6% in the quarter.
The first quarter, Medicare MCR was increased by 400 basis points due to COVID.
Sequentially, the MCR improved driven by this lower net effect of COVID and improved underlying performance compared to the first quarter.
We anticipate a full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s.
In Marketplace, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $35 million, increasing the MCR by 480 basis points.
The first quarter Marketplace MCR included a similar impact from the net effect of COVID, which increased the first quarter MCR by approximately 500 basis points.
The resulting sequential increase in MCR versus the first quarter reflects the normal seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits.
Due to the higher-than-expected impact from the net effect of COVID in the first half of the year, we now expect Marketplace pre-tax margins to moderate to low single digits.
We expect that when the COVID pandemic subsides, our Marketplace pre-tax margin will be squarely on target with our mid-single-digit pre-tax margin expectations.
Turning now to our balance sheet.
We received $145 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $564 million at the end of the quarter.
We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions.
At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity.
After funding our announced pending acquisitions, we will have year-end acquisition capacity of over $1.4 billion.
At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions, this gives us the ability to drive $3 billion to $4 billion in annualized revenue growth.
More importantly, at our current level of performance, this level of acquisition capacity is generated each year.
Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong.
Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense, unchanged from the first quarter.
Prior year reserve development in the second quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors.
Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA.
Our debt-to-cap ratio was 50%.
However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7 times and 43%, respectively.
These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position.
A few additional comments related to our earnings guidance.
We raised full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13.25 per share, which reflects the following: our underlying outperformance, an increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the net effect of COVID expectations, which has increased by $1 per share and is now expected to be approximately $2.50 per share for the full year, and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining six months of the year due to the COVID pandemic.
In a typical year, the seasonality of utilization and timing of open enrollment periods resulted in third quarter earnings being higher than fourth quarter earnings.
However, this year, we expect second half earnings to be distributed more evenly between the quarters due to the net effect of COVID and particularly the impact of risk sharing corridors.
As Joe discussed, we believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $5.
This is composed of several items.
The increased net effect of COVID, which is now expected to create a $2.50 per share decrease that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides.
Medicare risk score disruption that created approximately $1 a share overhang; and as we obtain our target margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky, and once Affinity and Cigna acquisitions are closed and synergized, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $2.
This embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily depressing our earnings profile.
There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022, including several possible scenarios for the impact of Medicaid membership redeterminations.
In short, our 2021 earnings jump-off point into 2022 is very strong.
Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
