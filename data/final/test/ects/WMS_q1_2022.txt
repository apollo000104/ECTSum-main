A copy of the release has also been included in an 8-K submitted to the SEC.
We achieved a record $669 million of sales in the first quarter, 32% growth over last year.
Growth was split fairly evenly, weighted a little bit more to favorable pricing than volume growth.
Demand remained strong at both ADS and in Infiltrator throughout our end markets and geographic footprint.
In addition, international sales increased 82% this quarter with growth in our Canadian, Mexican and exports businesses.
Our backlog and pace of orders remain favorable as well as our ability to capture price in the market, giving us confidence in the updated sales targets we issued today.
We have issued several price increases since late last year to cover inflationary cost pressure, and we'll continue to use our leading market position in that respect as well as ADS and Infiltrator's scale position in material procurement and recycling operations to procure material at the best possible cost and availability.
Our adjusted EBITDA increased 4% on a dollar basis given -- again, driven by the favorable pricing and strong volume growth.
The price increases we issued over the last 10 months largely covered the inflationary pressure on materials and diesel.
There are additional headwinds related to driver availability, an increase in the use of common carrier and an increase in common carrier rates that we are working to offset.
We remain confident in our ability to identify and execute the right mitigation programs and expand our margins over time.
Material prices started to rise in October 2020, increasing more significantly as a result of the winter storms that hit the Gulf region in February of 2021.
In the first quarter, our material cost per pound increased significantly compared to the prior year.
Additionally, in the second quarter, we will experience the largest gap between historically high material prices this year and historically low material prices of last year.
The price increases we pushed into the market are largely covering material, and we continue to raise prices in line with these material increases as well as reprice quotes over 30 days old to ensure we're recovering the sequentially higher cost.
Material availability has improved since our last call.
It comes at a price, but we are doing what it takes to give materials out to our facilities so we can support customer needs, including incurring additional transportation costs and shuffling production scheduling more than we have in the past.
We remain committed to meeting our customers' demand and have efforts underway to ensure we continue to do so.
Across the market, attracting and retaining manufacturing labor and drivers is difficult right now.
We've had to increase the pay rate in many locations to help mitigate this issue, both starting pay as well as raises for current employees.
In addition, last year, we delayed all manufacturing merit increases until the second quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making the first quarter year-over-year comparison more pronounced than usual.
Within transportation, there are three major factors driving additional costs.
One, we have a shortage of available drivers for our fleet, requiring us to utilize more common carriers than normal to service our customers.
Number two, common carrier rates are up over 50% year-on-year.
And number three, we're moving more material throughout the network to get it into the right locations so we can meet customer demand.
While three of our largest cost components, materials, labor and transportation, have a lot of moving parts, we're responding with the following programs.
To address the labor issues within manufacturing, we are focused on simplifying the manufacturing process for new employees, including focusing production and decreasing SKUs, reducing changeovers and deploy centralized scheduling techniques.
We've also consolidated inventory of some key products to fewer locations for better visibility and order management, again, simplifying the task and providing better visibility.
Management time is focused on a handful of locations where we have the most issues, particularly with labor and capacity.
We've created dedicated transportation lanes and are deploying route planning techniques to help with the transportation labor shortage.
As well, we've expanded the use of 3PL partnerships for retail to an additional region which freed up ADS fleet capacity for trade deliveries.
More broadly, on labor, we have added recruiting process outsourcing partnerships for our manufactured and transportation labor hiring, which has improved both the applicant flow and the onboarding process.
Where possible, we've increased pipe imports from our Mexican and Canadian operations to further supplement supply and availability in the U.S. Finally, we are making capital investments to increase capacity with some having an impact in Q4 for Infiltrator and the ADS pipe manufacturing.
We started up a pipe production line this month in the Midwest to increase capacity, and we've also made aggressive investments in the strong tech business to increase production capacity.
We saw capital spending increasing year-over-year in the first quarter, and this will continue as we invest in the long-term potential of both businesses.
All that said, the momentum underpinning the core drivers of our business remains strong.
Infiltrator maintained the high levels of profitability in the first quarter, despite similar challenges around materials, labor and transportation.
The international businesses also performed very well with double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth in each of those businesses.
The domestic pipe business is large and complex, and while we are very proud of the sales volume and pricing power, there are work guidance, particularly with labor and transportation, which we'll have to grind through and continue to improve.
While some of these work items are inflationary and potentially transitory, others are operational that needs to be worked through systematically.
And the areas where we started implementing programs using these techniques, namely the agriculture business, Canada and Florida, we've seen positive results over the years.
However, throughout our larger manufacturing network is our task now.
The ADS legacy and Infiltrator businesses combined to have their best sales quarter in our history.
The combination of the highest demand we've seen in our history across all regions simultaneously, in an environment with labor and driver shortages and rapid inflation.
This all came on us and our industry like very quickly in May and June.
And given this environment, we expect our profitability going forward to look different quarter-to-quarter this year, more like the seasonality in fiscal 2018 when we made the majority of our profitability dollar growth in the back half of the year.
On slide six, we present our first quarter fiscal 2020 financial performance.
There are some key points that I want to hit on from a results perspective.
Obviously, from a top line perspective, we had significant growth year-over-year, driven by both pricing and volume.
Legacy ADS pipe products grew 42% and Allied Products sales grew 13%.
Infiltrator sales increased 24% with double-digit sales growth in both tanks and leach field products.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased 4.5% to $167 million resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.9% in the quarter, down from 31.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Scott discussed in detail the actions we have taken around the largest drivers of the margin compression: materials, labor and transportation inflation as well as the labor availability.
Material costs are at the highest levels in recent memory and have continued to increase sequentially month-to-month throughout this year.
We've issued two more price increases since the end of our fiscal first quarter, one in July and another just last week.
We will hit the full run rate of the announced price increases that today in our fiscal third quarter.
From an SG&A perspective, the first quarter results contain approximately $2 million of wages, travel, medical and other expenses that were not incurred last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, commission expense increased in line with the sales growth we experienced in the first quarter year-over-year.
In summary, we have good line of sight to the cost impacting us and have actions in place to offset such as we move through the year.
Based on the timing of these actions, we expect to see most of this improvement in the second half of our fiscal year.
The long-term fundamentals of the business are still intact, and we will play out -- and will play out as we move past this unique period of higher inflation.
Moving to slide seven.
We generated $79 million of free cash flow this quarter compared to $124 million in the prior year, primarily driven by increased capital spending and working capital.
The impact from working capital was primarily due to the higher material costs moving to the balance sheet as compared to the year ago period.
We continue to make progress on our working capital initiatives.
And during the quarter, working capital decreased to approximately 19% of sales, down from 21% of sales last year.
Our first priority for capital deployment remains investing organically in the growth of the business, as demonstrated by the $15 million increase in capital expenditures we experienced in the first quarter.
For the full year, we continue to expect between $130 million and $150 million in capital expenditures, our largest investment being to support future growth, followed by our productivity and automation initiatives.
Further, as part of our disciplined capital deployment strategy, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for a total of $115 million in the first quarter, leaving $177 million remaining under our existing authorization as of June 30.
Our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was 1.2 times, and we ended the quarter with $480 million of liquidity.
Finally, on slide eight, we have updated our fiscal 2022 guidance.
Based on our performance to date, pricing actions taken, order activity, backlog and current market trends, we currently expect net sales to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, representing growth of 26% to 31% over the prior year.
Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is unchanged at a range of $635 million to $665 million, representing growth of 12% to 17% over last year.
The increase in our revenue guidance is due primarily to pricing that we've introduced into the market to date to offset the additional inflationary cost pressures we've discussed on the call today.
Operator, please open the lines.
