New factors emerge from time to time and it is simply not possible to predict all such factors.
On our call day, Allan will review highlights from our fiscal 2020 and then discuss why 2021 will be an important inflection year for the company.
Bob will cover our fourth quarter results in greater depth, and then I will then come back to provide our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and provide an update on how our balance sheet, liquidity and land spending will support our growth objectives for 2021 and beyond.
My comments will then be followed by a wrap-up by Allan.
In the beginning of our fiscal year, we laid out three strategic goals for 2020.
At that time, we had no idea the global economy would be turned upside down by a pandemic.
But we have an exceptionally talented group of employees who had the creativity and the grit to reinvent many of our business processes to deal with this new environment.
And it is because of them that I can tell you, we exceeded every one of our strategic goals.
First, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by more than 10% as gross margins expanded to reflect the benefits of product simplification and the price improvements we achieved.
Second, we generated a return on assets above 10%, up about 1 point from the prior year as we continue to grow EBITDA at a faster rate than our assets.
And finally, we achieved a net debt-to-EBITDA below five times as we simultaneously retire debt and add it to our already strong liquidity position.
Of course, some of the success can be attributed to the low mortgage rates and the big reassessment of living arrangements during the pandemic, but these results would not have been possible without the resiliency of our team.
We entered the new year with the dollar value of our backlog, up an astounding 50%, giving us both visibility and confidence moving forward.
But it's more than just our backlog that gives us confidence as many of the factors that contributed to sales strength last year remain in place.
While demand likely won't remain as torrid as it has been in the last several months, we're optimistic that new home demand will remain strong.
By historical standards, we've built far fewer new homes in the last decade than population growth, household formation or job growth would have predicted.
And those families have been living somewhere.
Now with remote work demonstrating long-lasting appeal, these deferred homebuyers are on our website, visiting our communities and buying our homes.
They're finding that low rates have given them surprising purchasing power, but supply is highly constrained, and prices are rising as we work to offset higher land, labor and material costs.
With this supportive backdrop, 2021 will be an important inflection year for the company.
Over the last 10 years, as we've executed our balanced growth strategy, we've translated incremental gains and operating metrics into more than $200 million of improvement in adjusted EBITDA.
At the same time, we've actually reduced our operating assets by about 10%.
These efforts have led to big increases in profitability and returns, but very little new order growth.
In fact, that has been the tension at the heart of our balanced growth strategy to improve profitability and returns while reducing debt at the same time.
Over the last five years, we've spent nearly $2.3 billion on land and land development activity.
That's a big-sounding number, but it was about $270 million less than the cash we generated from the land related to our home closings.
So what did we do with that extra cash?
We paid off debt.
In fact, over that same time period, we spent about $450 million retiring and refinancing debt.
Other than modest share repurchases, nearly all of the cash we generated was used to retire debt and build liquidity.
That allocation of capital wasn't focused on top line growth, but it was the necessary and prudent course of action.
It has radically reduced financial risk, lowered interest expense and accelerated our ability to use our deferred tax assets.
The exciting news is that this year is different.
Entering 2021, our liquidity and anticipated profitability are such that we expect to achieve the last leg of our debt retirement objective, which is to get total debt below $1 billion by the end of 2022 using only a portion of our future profits.
This means we can reinvest all of the cash generated from operations, as well as the balance of our profitability for growth.
Our balance sheet and lot position will not continue shrinking.
That is a fundamental change in our capital allocation posture.
After many years of hard work, we can now tilt our balanced growth strategy toward growth, while we have operational momentum and a supportive macro environment.
Investors may wonder about the time lag between increasing investment and generating growth.
Well it's true that land purchase this year is unlikely to contribute to this year's financial results, but our efforts to grow profitability will deliver results this year.
For 2021, we're focused on achieving the following objectives, first, we expect to generate slightly higher EBITDA and double-digit earnings-per-share growth.
Starting with a much larger backlog will help us overcome the reduction in community count we will experience this year.
At the same time, we expect to increase our operating margin by delivering higher-margin homes and maximizing our overhead leverage.
Earnings per share will benefit from significantly lower interest expense.
Second, we expect to grow our total lot position.
We'll achieve this through higher on spending and an even greater use of options, positioning us for community count growth.
And third, we will continue to retire debt as we approach our deleveraging goal.
Looking beyond this year, we're positioning our company for ongoing profitable growth, characterized by improving returns and funded with a less leveraged balance sheet.
Looking at the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, new home orders increased nearly 40% to 2,009, driven by the highest fourth quarter sales pace we've achieved in the last decade.
Homebuilding revenue decreased 12% to $679 million, primarily driven by a 14% decrease in closings related to the impact of the pandemic on order and construction timing.
Our gross margin, excluding amortized interest, impairments and abandonments, was 21.7%, up approximately 180 basis points.
SG&A was relatively flat on an absolute basis but rose as a percentage of total revenue to 11.1%, reflecting the decrease in revenue.
This led to adjusted EBITDA of $77.1 million in the quarter, down slightly in dollar terms, but up over 70 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 11.2%.
Total GAAP interest expense was down nearly 16% or $6 million.
Our tax expense for the quarter was about $9 million for an average annual tax rate of 25%.
Finally, these components taken together led to $24.6 million of net income from continuing operations or $0.82 per share in earnings this quarter.
Let's start with a review of our operational and financial expectations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 -- 2021 compared to the prior year.
Orders are expected to be essentially flat despite an approximately 15% decline in community count.
Closing should be relatively flat versus the prior year.
Although our backlog was up significantly heading into this year, this was largely driven by sales in August and September, which will close in our second quarter.
Additionally, we remain focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience and in light of anticipated labor and material constraints, we are planning for slightly longer cycle times.
Our ASP is expected to be approximately $380,000.
We expect gross margin to be up more than 150 basis points, around 21.5%.
Although we experienced higher lumber prices last quarter, this won't materially impact Q1 performance but will be a modest headwind in Q2.
SG&A as a percentage of total revenue should be down about 50 basis points, reflecting the benefit of our continued focus on controlling costs.
We expect EBITDA to be up more than 20%.
Interest amortized as a percentage of homebuilding revenue should be in the low 4s, supporting our goal of double-digit net income growth.
Our tax rate is expected to be about 25%.
And this should all lead to earnings per share above $0.30, up significantly versus the prior year.
We ended the fourth quarter with $578 million of liquidity, up more than $200 million versus the prior year.
This reflected about $328 million of unrestricted cash and nothing outstanding on our revolver.
We are positioned to emphasize growth even with the commitment to retire more than $50 million of debt this year.
At the end of the fourth quarter, we owned or controlled a three-year supply of land based on our trailing 12-month closing.
Fourth quarter land spending of $116 million, but our full year total spend of $441 million, it was about $100 million below the amount we generated from the land related to home closings, reflecting the deliberate pause in spending we undertook at the onset of the COVID pandemic.
We expect to recapture this activity in 2021, which is likely to result in land spend approaching $600 million.
On the table on the right-hand side of Slide 11, we depict our expectations for near-term community count, which we anticipate will likely trough in the 120s in the fourth quarter.
Community count growth will be evident in fiscal 2022 as we benefit from our increased land spend and the greater use of options.
With the strength in the new home market, land prices are somewhat frothy across our footprint.
However, we are confident that we can achieve this increase in our land acquisition activity without materially changing our risk profile for three reasons.
First, we have already contracted for or approved the majority of our land acquisition activity for the coming year, giving us confidence in our ability to fulfill our acquisition targets without chasing low-margin sites.
Second, we are increasingly controlling lots and options, allowing us to better leverage our incremental spend and manage risk.
As a matter of business [Phonetic], we grew our option lot as a percentage of active lots by 6 points to 35% last quarter -- last year and expect a similar improvement this year.
And finally, our underwriting process and financial thresholds have not changed.
We continue to include no price appreciation in our modeling and our required rate -- our required return and profitably metrics are unchanged.
Fiscal 2020 was a challenging year, but with our team's resiliency, we rose to the occasion and generated very strong results.
We improved profitability and returns, increased sales paces to close the year and grew our backlog significantly, giving us confidence going into fiscal '21.
Importantly, we also positioned the company to adopt a more consistently growth-oriented allocation of capital.
Of course, our highest priority remains the safety of our employees, customers and trade partners, and we will continue to adapt our activities to that end.
As I say every quarter, I'm confident we have the people, the strategy and the resources to create value over the coming years.
I didn't let him see this part of the script, so he's squirming a little bit right now.
As we announced this summer, Bob is stepping down as CFO this week, and I thought a moment of recognition was warranted.
Bob joined me here 12 years ago at a very difficult time in our company's history and was integral in our turnaround.
Since then, he's been deeply involved in every aspect of our business.
He's been my partner and mentor to our corporate and operational leaders for his entire tenure.
In fact, all of our constituents are indebted to him for his many contributions.
Going forward, our management team is in great shape.
Dave is ready to take the next step in his career, and he and I will ensure that this is a seamless transition.
Now I'll get to work.
Operator, please open the line for Q&A.
