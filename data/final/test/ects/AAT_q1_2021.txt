Both are now available on the Investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com.
First and foremost, once again we hope that this letter finds you and your loved ones safe.
And our financial results will continue to improve into 2021.
Over the past year the COVID-19 pandemic severely affected most industries, commercial real estate being no exception.
We knew at the onset of the pandemic that American Assets Trust would not be impervious to this economic impact, but we were confident that the high quality, irreplaceable properties and asset class diversity of our portfolio combined with the strength of our balance sheet and ample liquidity would pull us through this.
As we've worked our way through these past 12 months, however, we realized that it is the resiliency of our properties and our company's employees that has enabled us to weather this storm.
And fortunately, to embark on the path to recovery.
We are proud of our response to the challenges presented to us in 2020 and our ability to successfully operate for our company, while keeping our employees and customers as safe as possible.
We've been through hard times before and each time we have emerged stronger, which is our expectation now.
As we celebrate our 10th anniversary of being a New York Stock Exchange listed company, we are reminded that our commitment to our stockholders has always remained front and center.
We will continue to do our best to accretively grew our asset base and shareholder wealth, focusing on both organic growth and development opportunities as they present themselves within our existing portfolios as well as acquisitions in our targeted coastal West Coast markets with a primary focus on the office sector going forward at this time.
Finally, I want to mention that the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.28 a share for the first quarter, consistent with our previous dividend, which is, we believe is supported by our collection efforts in the first quarter.
The border is -- Board is looking for the rebound in Waikiki which impacts our Embassy Suites and our -- and retail on Waikiki Beach Walk.
Once the mandatory quarantine has been eliminated we [Indecipherable] see the beginning of a recovery in Waikiki which will about -- allow the Board to consider an increase in the dividend.
We are hopeful that this will recur in the third quarter and hopefully sooner.
Adam, Bob and Steve will go into more detail on our various asset segments, collections and financial results.
Now more than ever.
We are feeling more bullish than at any time over the past 12 months, now that the vaccine is widely available, the COVID 19 governmental restrictions in our coastal markets have lightened considerably and we are seeing firsthand the consumer behavior has begun reverting closer to pre-pandemic levels.
Perhaps most significantly in California Governor Newsom announced recently that the state will fully reopen its economy on June 15th, lifting substantially all the restrictions that have guided daily life for more than a year in California, where currently two-thirds of our annualized base rent is derived.
We would expect our other coastal markets to follow similarly in the months to come.
Meanwhile, we are encouraged and seeing our shopping center parking lots full, our office tenants returning or scheduling their return to office, tourism ramping up in Hawaii and public schools in our markets are starting to open back up, allowing parents to return to work, shopping and the like.
Our collections have continued to improve each quarter since the pandemic began and improved each month in Q1 with the collection rate north of 93% for the first quarter.
We expect this collection trend to continue to improve going forward with April at approximately 90% to date.
Furthermore, we had approximately $800,000 of deferred rent due from about 100 tenants in Q1 based on COVID-19 related lease modifications entered into in 2020 and we have collected approximately 88% of those deferred amount, we believe this further validates our strategy of supporting our struggling retailers through the government mandated closure.
Today, we have avoided any material impact from retailer bankruptcy having lost only 13,000 square feet in the aggregate out of our over 3 million square foot retail portfolio, which we believe is a testament to us having superior locations at these restructured tenants want to remain in.
As we mentioned before, we continue working with challenge retailers with a heavy focus currently on those in Waikiki, who historically have been solid operators to bridge them through to the recovery as tourism continues to ramp up, which is primarily from the US Mainland at this point as Asian countries have not yet relaxed COVID restrictions and their travel to Hawaii yet.
Additionally, we are seeing significant positive activity and engagement with new retailers for vacant or distressed spaces in our retail portfolio as we negotiate new retail leases and term sheets, which we will keep you posted on.
On the multifamily front, we have hired a new community manager at our Hassalo on Eighth property who we -- who we expect will lead Hassalo to increased occupancy and better financial results over the remainder of the year.
Furthermore, the 133 unit master lease with the private university in our San Diego multifamily portfolio expires at the end of May and our San Diego multifamily team led by Abigail Rex is fully engaged on additional marketing and advertising campaigns to entice students to remain in expiring units and to attract new prospects.
To date we have leased approximately 20% of those expiring units and expect to have the majority of them released by the end of summer.
Finally, I want to mention that last week we issued our 2020 sustainability report which covers our 2020 operations and highlights our initiatives and commitments across a range of topics, including health and safety, environmental, social responsibility, corporate governor and was prepared entirely in-house at AAT.
These initiatives were a massive collaborative effort from our employee base, led by our sustainability committee with representatives from virtually every department in our company and oversight from our executive management team and Board of Directors.
We are proud of our efforts to-date, particularly our focus on human capital, but we know we have a lot more work to do going forward on all fronts.
Please reach out to any questions.
Last night we reported first quarter 2021 FFO per share of $0.38, first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.02.
I believe it is important to note that the FFO in the first quarter includes a charge of approximately $4.3 million for the early extinguishment of our $150 million Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series A, which were due on October 31, 2021.
Without the charge for the early extinguishment of debt, our first quarter 2021 FFO per share would have been approximately $0.44.
From a financial perspective, it was a relatively quiet quarter.
We did end up close to our expectations.
Based on the current environment same-store metrics are down in retail as expected and office was also lower for the quarter, but it is expected to end with 8% or greater same-store cash NOI for the year ended 2021.
At the end of the first quarter, net of One Beach, which is under redevelopment, our office portfolio stood at approximately 94% leased, with just 3.4% expiring through the end of 2021.
Our top 10 office tenants represented 50.2% of our total office base rent.
Given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located with technology and life science as the key market drivers.
Our office portfolio has weathered the crisis well.
Current status by region are as follows: Bellevue is 96.5% leased; Portland is 97.1% leased; San Francisco is 100% leased, net of One Beach; and San Diego is 89.1% leased with two buildings under renovation at Torrey Reserve making up 5.8% of San Diego's vacancy and 2.6% of the office portfolio's vacancy.
Our strategy of offering lease term flexibility while preserving pre-COVID rental rates produced 36 comparable new and renewal leases over the last 12 months, totaling 182,000 rentable square feet with a weighted average increase of 8.9% over prior rents on a cash basis and 16.9% on a straight-line basis.
The weighted average lease term was 3.3 years with just $8.7 per rental square foot in TIs and incentives.
We experienced limited small tenant attrition due to COVID and other business challenges during the quarter resulting in a net loss of approximately 31,000 rentable square feet, none of which was lost to a competitor.
However, smaller tenant activity has picked up significantly with tenants willing to commit to longer-term leases at favorable rental rate.
Even more encouraging is the push to return to the office and the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality larger blocks of space in select markets including San Diego and Bellevue.
We continue to strategically invest in our current portfolio through renovation, redevelopment and ground-up development.
The renovation at two of the 14 buildings at Torrey Reserve should be complete this summer.
In the process, we are enhancing the campus amenities and aggregating large -- large blocks of space in the Del Mar Heights submarket to meet demand and take advantage of pricing power.
Construction has commenced on the redevelopment of One Beach Street in San Francisco with delivery in the first half of 2022 and construction is nearly complete on the redevelopment of 710 Oregon Square in the Lloyd sub-market of Portland.
One Beach will grow to over 102,000 square feet and 710 Oregon Square will add more than 33,000 square feet to our office portfolio.
Construction is also commenced on Tower 3 at La Jolla Commons, a 213,000 square foot, 11 story Class A plus office tower in the UTC submarket of San Diego with expected completion in Q2 or Q3 of 2023.
We are encouraged by the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality large blocks of space in UTC.
We are optimistic about our office portfolio as we move forward into the rest of 2021 and beyond.
