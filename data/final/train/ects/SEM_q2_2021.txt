We are very pleased with the financial results of the quarter, as well as a number of other business goals that we accomplished during the quarter.
We experienced top-line growth in all four of our business segments compared to both the same quarter last year and pre-pandemic same quarter in 2019.
The volumes in our inpatient/outpatient business segments are trending very nicely and are well above pre-pandemic volume numbers.
In addition to the volume growth, the inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation hospitals and clinics posted their highest quarters for adjusted EBITDA in the history of the company.
Concentra has made nice strides with volume improvement as more industries such as airlines, hospitality, municipalities and schools reopen.
On the development front, on May 1, Scripps Healthcare entered into our existing joint venture partnership with UC San Diego Health on our 110-bed critical illness recovery hospital in San Diego, California.
In June, we closed on a new outpatient joint venture with Mon Health in West Virginia, which marked our entry into the state for outpatient rehab.
On July 1, we entered into a new long-term acute care hospital joint venture with Ascension Saint Thomas in Nashville, contributing our 70-bed Nashville hospital to the joint venture and moving forward with plans to add a 30-bed satellite hospital within a hospital at their Saint Thomas West Campus later this year.
Also on July 1, we entered into a new joint venture with CHS Northwest Healthcare in Tucson, Arizona, and acquired a 47-bed long-term acute care hospital, here at Tucson, which we plan to relocate to Northwest Medical Center later this year.
And earlier the -- earlier this week, we entered into a new outpatient rehab joint ventures with Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, California, contributing our 26 outpatient clinics in that market to the joint venture.
We continue to work on finalizing the acquisition of Acuity Healthcare, which operates five long-term acute care hospitals through joint venture partnerships in New Jersey and West Virginia.
We expect the deal to close sometime late Q3 or early Q4.
Our development pipeline remain strong as we continue to look for opportunities to expand our footprint and partner with leading healthcare institutions throughout the country.
In addition, last week, U.S. News & World Report released our annual rankings of top rehabilitation hospitals in the country.
Our Kessler Institute of Rehabilitation in New Jersey was ranked No.
4 in the country, it's 29th consecutive year of being named among the nation's best.
In addition, this year, for the first time, we have three of our joint venture partner hospitals making the list.
They are Baylor Scott & White Institute for Rehabilitation in Dallas at No.
13, Emory Rehabilitation Hospital in Atlanta at No.
26 and OhioHealth Rehabilitation Hospital in Columbus, Ohio at No.
I couldn't be more proud of our clinician, clinical and operational teams at these hospitals and throughout the rest of our portfolio of hospitals for their hard work, expertise and dedication to the care and treatment of our patients.
Two other items I wanted to note are the Centers for Disease and Control the CDC and Select Medical collaborated on a clinical study regarding long-term impact of COVID-19, which was recently published in the morbidity and mortality weekly report.
This quarter, we also included monthly results from 2019 to provide a data point, where each of our business segments were prior to the pandemic compared to where they are currently.
We will continue to include this information as long as it provides meaningful insight to the impact of COVID-19 on the company's financial performance.

As we had mentioned in our most recent earnings call, staffing remains an issue in the critical illness recovery hospitals and it did have an impact on the number of patients we were able to admit for the quarter.
We had a number of our hospitals that were unable to accept patients due to lack of clinician availability.
