North American irrigation revenues were $52.8 million compared to $53.6 million in the same quarter last year.
The decrease resulted primarily from lower engineering services revenue related to a project in the prior year that did not repeat and this was partially offset by higher irrigation equipment unit volume.
In the international irrigation markets, revenues of $34.6 million increased $4.8 million or 16% compared to $29.7 million in the same quarter last year.

We expect to see some margin headwinds in our second quarter as the backlog of orders received prior to the price increases are shipped.
