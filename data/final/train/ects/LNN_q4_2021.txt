North America irrigation revenues of $53.5 million increased 30% compared to last year's fourth quarter.
The increase in North America irrigation revenues resulted from a combination of higher irrigation equipment unit sales volume and higher average selling prices.
In the international irrigation markets, revenues of $71.7 million increased 100% compared to last year's fourth quarter.
The increase in international irrigation revenues resulted primarily from higher unit sales volumes along with higher selling prices and a favorable foreign currency translation impact of $2.8 million.
The largest sales volume increases were in the Brazil and Middle East markets.
Total irrigation segment operating income for the fourth quarter was $10.6 million, an increase of 78% compared to the prior year fourth quarter.
And operating margin was 8.4% of sales compared to 7.8% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter.
The impact of higher irrigation system unit volume was partially offset by the impact of higher raw material and other costs.
We continue to face some margin headwind as the realization of pricing actions lags the impact of cost increases.
Fourth quarter operating results were also reduced by approximately $5 million resulting from the impact of the LIFO method of accounting for inventory, under which higher raw material costs are recognized in cost of goods sold rather than in ending inventory values.
During the quarter, we added additional inventory as a buffer against supply chain uncertainty, expected cost increases and as part of a build ahead plan in connection with the temporary shutdown at the Lindsay, Nebraska facility to install productivity upgrades.
We expect to realize some benefit of this fourth quarter LIFO impact in future periods as inventory quantities decline.

Current year results reflect lower revenues and the less favorable margin mix of revenues compared to the prior year fourth quarter and were also reduced by approximately $1 million resulting from the impact of LIFO.
