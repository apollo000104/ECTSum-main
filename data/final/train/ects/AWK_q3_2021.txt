Before we move to questions, I want to provide an update on our York wastewater acquisition.
On October 29, we received a formal Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission acceptance of Pennsylvania American Waters application for the acquisition of York Wastewater.
We remain on schedule to close in the second quarter of 2022.
York is another great example, providing solutions to water and wastewater challenges where we can leverage our scale and drive efficiencies.
It should also be the case in Chester, Pennsylvania where as you know, Pennsylvania American Water offered the highest purchase price for that system.
We believe our submitted superior offer, which was the highest by $15 million, will provide the most benefit for that community.
We eagerly await the receivers decision as we would remain in competition to acquire the system.
Also, Cheryl spent some time in our accelerated capital plan as it relates to the resiliency of our systems.
I just want to highlight that again.
You saw the incredible photos of how our flood wall protected our plant, enabling us to continue to provide water service for more than 1 million people in Central New Jersey during Hurricane Ida.
Proper planning and key investments in projects like the flood wall are critical to our business.
This is fundamental to our capital planning process and has been for decades.
Time and time again, we've seen the benefit of our resiliency investments and how they allow us to continue to provide essential services even during significant weather events.
