I'm joined on the call today by Michael Happe, president and chief executive officer; and Bryan Hughes, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
These factors are identified in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to read.
As always, we appreciate your interest in Winnebago Industries and taking the time to discuss our fiscal '22 second-quarter results.
I'll start the call with an overview of our performance during the second quarter and what factors are driving those results.
Winnebago Industries is built on our strong momentum and delivered robust results in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, capitalizing on sustained and elevated demand for our portfolio of premium products.
We grew revenues by 39% year over year to $1.2 billion, matching the previous sales record set last quarter.
Overall, our results were shaped by two key dynamics: first, sustained and powerful consumer demand drove higher unit sales compared to the prior year; and second, Winnebago Industries' successful execution of pricing actions to offset higher material and component costs.
Also, the Barletta pontoon boat business recently acquired this past August, contributed nine percentage points of growth, and continues to exceed our expectations and gain market share in the pontoon boat market.
I want to spend a minute talking about these drivers in more detail.
It all begins with the consumers' continued strong affinity for the outdoor lifestyle and in particular, Winnebago Industries premium brands.
Through our interactions with our consumers and feedback we receive from our dealers, consumers clearly recognize our products as being differentiated.
This differentiation is a result of our relentless focus on our golden threads of quality, service, and innovation.
Robust consumer demand is a powerful undercurrent that we believe will continue to propel our company's growth through the current fiscal year and beyond.
A recent RV industry association study confirmed that 51% of new RVers in the 2020 and 2021 time periods suggested that that reasons surrounding COVID were certainly the impetus for purchasing in RV.
We are confident though that many of these interest trends have become ingrained and that consumers will continue to invest in products that enable them to pursue their love for the outdoors.
Compelling data supports our thesis.
Our friends at the campgrounds of America cited a 16% projected increase in households camping through November of 2021 versus the same period in 2020.
Here are some other nuggets from the previously noted and recently released new RV owners survey conducted by the RVIA.
Contrary to some theory speculating on possibly low retention of 2020 and 2021 first-time RV buyers.
New purchasers are most likely to keep and use their current RV into 2022 and beyond.
With 50% already seeking an upgrade via new parts or a different RV altogether.
Six in 10 new millennial RVs, those who bought an RV for the first time in 2020 and 2021, already say they are likely to purchase another RV in the future.
As it relates to the growing popularity of flexible work, among new RVers 25% of millennials and 27% of Gen Xers stated that they used an RV for a place to stay while working as a reason for purchasing the RV.
Importantly, Winnebago Industries is already capitalizing on the sustained demand drivers.
Our second-quarter total unit sales grew year over year despite a tough comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which was nearing the height of the COVID-19-driven demand spike.
Strong attendance at the recent Tampa RV show and the Miami Boat Show resulted in retail sales that exceeded our expectations.
In fact, most of our retail shows this spring are seeing record sales for our brands.
This foreshadows a solid spring selling season that is historically reflected in our second-half results.
The combined tailwinds of societal trends, Winnebago Industries proven portfolio brand strength, and sharp execution spells great opportunity in the future for our business.
We remain confident that there remains strong engagement in the outdoors by consumers and Winnebago Industries is positioned to continue growing market share in both the RV and marine industries.
On a trailing three-month basis through January, our RV market share was 14.3%, up a full 100 basis points from 13.3% for the same period in 2021.
And in our marine segment, Barletta has now grown to be the fifth-largest pontoon boat company by market share at 4.6% on a trailing three-month basis through December, and recent retail results show them approaching and breaking the 5% barrier.
This is a meaningful improvement from just seven months ago when we completed the Barletta acquisition.
Speaking of Barletta, I am pleased to report that its differentiated pontoon portfolio has continued to perform above our expectations and exceeded the calendar 2021 performance targets we set when we announced the acquisition.
The second major driver of our revenue results was pricing actions.
The positive demand environment and the unique strength of our brands positioned Winnebago Industries well to take continued pricing actions to offset component and material cost inflation and preserve margin performance across our segments.
We began taking pricing actions ahead of inflation in the second quarter of last year.
As the spring selling season gets underway, we will continue to evaluate our pricing power as needed as a lever to offset higher materials and component costs while still balancing and driving market share gains.
This is a testament to the resiliency of the demand environment and the clear quality of our expanded product portfolio.
Our strong top-line performance was coupled with excellent operational efficiencies internally.
I tip my cap to the entire Winnebago Industries team for another quarter of net strong execution, which is especially appreciated these days as the supply chain remains volatile.
We continue to work collaboratively with our suppliers to get materials on time so we can get products out the door as efficiently as possible for our customers and dealer partners while not sacrificing quality and service.
Our motorhome business this past quarter probably faced the most significant supply chain constraints, holding that segment back from optimal performance in this period.
Our teammates efforts, though, enabled us at a consolidated level to power through the supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures that we continue to experience at levels comparable to the first quarter.
With our strong execution and pricing actions, Winnebago Industries delivered gross margin of 18.6% during the second quarter, equal to the great results last year.
A focus on operational excellence will continue to be a critical component of our strategy going forward, creating organic and flexible capacity, driving productivity and margin improvement opportunities, and ensuring industry-leading product quality.
Winnebago Industries robust backlogs have increased versus last year and are significantly higher than the second quarter 2020 period due to continued strong in consumer demand.
Keeping dealer inventories in all of our segments at acceptable levels throughout the fiscal 2022 year for our dealer partners is a key focus area for all of our teams.
And I am fully confident they will continue to rise to the challenge to meet the high retail and wholesale demand levels in a disciplined manner.
We are fortunate to have a world-class team of Winnebago Industries employees and strategic partners.
Working together, we remain uniquely well-positioned to continue capturing outsized growth and delivering value to all our stakeholders as more families take to the great outdoors.
As Mike mentioned, second-quarter revenues, including results for Barletta were $1.2 billion, reflecting an increase of 39%, compared to $839.9 million for the fiscal 2021 period.
Excluding Barletta, our organic growth for second quarter was 29%.
We were pleased to see that revenue growth was achieved in all three segments against a very robust 2021 comparison period.
Growth in total was driven by a combination of pricing actions and unit shipments.
We delivered another period of very strong profitability in the quarter, evidenced by meaningful growth despite a steep year-over-year comparison.
Gross profit was $216.6 million, representing an increase of 38%, compared to $156.6 million for the fiscal 2021 period.
Gross profit margin of 18.6% was equal to last year, driven by operating leverage and pricing offset by higher material and component costs as well as some operating inefficiencies caused by supply chain constraints and the associated inconsistencies in the deliveries of parts and subcomponents.
Operating income was $136.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 37% compared to $100 million for the second quarter of last year.
Our second-quarter operating income includes $0.5 million in acquisition-related costs and $4.6 million of incremental amortization of intangible assets related to the Barletta acquisition.
Fiscal 2022 second-quarter net income was $91.2 million, an increase of 32%, compared to $69.1 million in the prior-year quarter.
Note that fiscal 2022 net income includes $6.5 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustment, which is included in non-operating income related to the earn-out included in the deal structure associated with the Barletta acquisition.
You will note that we are removing this deal consideration in the calculation of adjusted EPS.
We are pleased to note that Barletta performance through the end of calendar 2021 as specified by the July 2021 purchase agreement will result in the full dispensation of $15 million which is the maximum payout for the first earn-out period tied to calendar year 2021 performance.
As stated previously, recall that we structured the earnout in such a manner that the multiple on this deal is further reduced as the earn-out that is paid increases.
Reported earnings per diluted share was $2.69, compared to reported earnings per diluted share of $2.04 in the same period last year.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.14, which represents an increase of 42%, compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.21 in the same period last year.
Now I'll turn to our segment performance, starting with our towable segment.
towable segment revenues were $646.6 million for the second quarter, up 47% over the prior year, primarily driven by pricing increases across the segment and unit growth of 13%.
Unit growth of 13% is especially strong given last year's 55% growth versus fiscal year 2020 for the same time period.
Segment adjusted EBITDA was $100.6 million, up 61% over the prior-year period.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6% increased 140 basis points over the prior year, driven by operating leverage and pricing, partially offset by cost input inflation.
Next, let's turn to our motorhome segment.
In the second quarter, revenues for the motorhome segment were $417.6 million, up 9% from the prior year driven by pricing increases across the segment.
Segment adjusted EBITDA was $46.1 million, representing a decrease of 10% from the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was a strong 11%, while a decrease of 230 basis points from the prior year.
In the current quarter, we experienced ongoing supply chain inconsistencies in the delivery of chassis and other key components that were disruptive to our operational flow and introduce inefficiencies into the environment as compared to very high productivity across our operations in the prior year.
While we expect such inefficiencies to be remedied in the longer term, they did impact the current quarter.
It should be noted that the pricing actions taken to date in the motorhome segment continued to outpace the inflationary impacts on our products.
And the pricing versus inflation equation is not a driver of the margin reduction versus last year.
Finally, let's turn to our marine segment.
In the second quarter, revenues for the marine segment were $97.3 million.
The retail trends for the Barletta and Chris-Craft businesses remain strong and dealer inventories remain low.
marine segment adjusted EBITDA of $13.0 million was $11.9 million higher than the same period last year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.3%, 620 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the addition of the Barletta business.
Turning now to the balance sheet.
We continue to maintain a healthy liquidity position with approximately $327 million available, including an untapped ABL of $192.5 million.
Our leverage ratio is currently at 0.8 times.
From a capital allocation perspective, we continue to prioritize investment in our businesses to fuel organic growth.
On a fiscal year-to-date basis, capex spending is $43.4 million, which is three times higher than last year's year-to-date capex.
We continue to carry elevated inventory as a means of mitigating some of the supply inconsistencies that we encounter on a daily basis.
While this is a detraction from generating high cash flow in the near term, we continue to view this as a prudent action to support our operations and believe that this cash investment will liquidate in the longer term and be available for other capital allocation priorities as the eventual drawdown in working capital occurs.
During the quarter, share buybacks totaled $40 million, and on a year-to-date basis, we have bought back $59.6 million worth of shares.
As discussed previously, our dividend this year is running at a 50% higher than it was last year.
Combining share buybacks with dividends, we have returned a robust $115 million to shareholders on a trailing 12-month basis through the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
This is approximately four times the prior year's trailing 12-month period.
That concludes my review of our quarterly financials.
Mike, back to you.
In addition to delivering strong financial results and market share growth, Winnebago Industries continued our deep commitment to our corporate responsibility in our communities and for our shareholders.
At the January RV consumer show in Tampa, we revealed the e-RV, the first all-electric zero-emission motor home concept from a major RV manufacturing.
The e-RV concept vehicle is an entirely new all-electric zero-emission RV that incorporates an advanced drivetrain and battery package that also powers all the living area systems of the coach.
Designed by our advanced technology group for a new generation of RVers who want to preserve the natural world as much as they want to enjoy it, the e-RV combines all-electric operation with sustainable and innovative materials.
We look forward to talking more about the e-RV as we move closer to commercialization.
Our go-to-market version is sure to bring significantly enhanced features and capabilities than the concept model shown.
In addition to the exciting e-RV, our Advanced Technology Group is also actively engaged on electrification relevant to marine and RV towable products as we continue our legacy of innovation and explore new frontiers and outdoor lifestyle products for the benefit of our customers, investors, and communities.
Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2022.
I want to reiterate my confidence that the demand for outdoor lifestyle products and particularly Winnebago Industries brands will continue to be very robust.
Looking at the RV industry at a macro level, we believe wholesale shipments for the calendar year could be down low to mid-single digits percentage-wise, as compared to the record 600,000 units shipped in calendar 2021.
Backlogs remain elevated as supply chain constraints persist, which we expect to be an ongoing reality throughout 2022.
We will continue to work closely with our suppliers to mitigate issues as much as possible and provide our dealer partners with quality units to replenish their inventories.
We anticipate Industry towable inventories to recover to a new normal first and mid-2022, followed by motorized later this calendar year and for some brands into 2023, especially our Newmar brand.
marine inventories will be the last to recover, and it could be well into 2023 or beyond for that to happen.
From an RV retail sales perspective, we have mentioned previously, and still maintain that we expect industry RV retail sales in calendar 2022 will likely be the second highest on record.
More specifically, we believe retail sales will be down mid- to high single digits percentage-wise.
This level of retail sales, combined with the wholesale shipment perspective mentioned earlier, will bring total dealer inventories back to reasonable levels and reflect dealer turns that we believe are sustainable into the foreseeable future.
We also believe that dealers will be targeting inventory levels that will generate elevated turns versus historical times and higher operating profits.
As always, in this very dynamic industry, our enterprise will responsibly produce and ship product.
While we anticipate the supply chain constraints and inflation to continue, we will work closely with our suppliers to mitigate the impact of those forces as much as possible.
Most importantly, we will continue to match our production levels with confirmed dealer orders.
This enterprisewide mandate at Winnebago Industries is imperative within our business model and is especially important as the industry works to replenish but not overdrive dealer inventory levels.
In short, we are continuing to focus on executing our proven strategies and building on our strong momentum.
We are investing in the future of our business as well, with significant capital projects, especially related to new product line expansion, future innovation, and stronger customer intimacy tools.
The unique strength of Winnebago Industries brands will position us to keep winning in the positive demand environment.
And our employees' relentless hard work and dedication will allow us to deliver superior execution despite supply chain constraints and inflation, which we are constantly monitoring.
We have much to navigate and continued room for improvement.
I'd like to remind our investors of the significant progress we've made in the last five to six years.
Our trailing 12-month sales of $4.3 billion, compares to $976 million at the end of fiscal 2015.
Our fiscal year-to-date 19.2% gross margin, compares to 10.7% in fiscal 2015.
Our current three-month trailing RV share of 14.3%, compares to 2.9% at the end of 2015.
Our approximate working capital of 11% in this fiscal year, compares favorably to 20% in 2015.
Our leverage ratio is under one times for each of the last four fiscal quarters, and in the last 12 months, we have returned more than $100 million of cash to shareholders.
We are proud of our team's hard work, but we recognize the bar is high in the short term and in the long term, both in the marketplace, but with our shareholders.
We are confident that Winnebago Industries has significant headroom for sustained profitable growth across our portfolio and enhanced value creation for our end consumers, dealers, employees, and shareholders.
While we do not have any physical operations in the region and feel that we can manage any indirect supply chain implications, our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people, and everyone affected by this tragic situation.
As part of our commitment to corporate citizenship and to our values, Winnebago Industries has made a grant to the Center For Disaster Philanthropy and joined in support with the National Association of Manufacturers recent resolution condemning Russian aggression.
Like all of you, we sincerely hope for a peaceful resolution.
