Well, we had an exciting quarter.
I'm not sure how else to describe it.
Among other accomplishments, we celebrated the addition of store #2000 to our portfolio.
We were recognized by Inside Self-Storage as the Best Third-Party Management company in the industry, and we achieved some of the strongest operating results in our company's history.
Same-store occupancy once again reached a new all-time high during the quarter at over 97%, with vacates continuing at lower-than-historic levels.
Our strong occupancy resulted in exceptional pricing power.
Achieved rates to new customers in the quarter were 43% higher than 2020 levels and 41% greater than 2019 levels.
In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as state of emergency rate restrictions continued to be lifted throughout the country.
Other income improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to increased late fees contributing 30 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter.
We had modestly higher discounts due to higher street rates, but their impact was offset by lower bad debt.
These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 18.4%, a 480 basis point acceleration from Q2.
And same-store NOI growth of 27.8%, an acceleration of 760 basis points.
In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 41.2%.
Turning to external growth.
The acquisition market remains very active but expensive in our view.
Our investment team has never been busier, and we have found the most success acquiring lease-up properties and/or acquiring stores with the joint venture partner.
While most of our transactions have been in relatively small bites, the total is adding up, allowing us to increase our investment guidance to $700 million for the year.
Also, our approach has resulted in better-than-market average yields.
But we are much more focused on FFO per share accretion than total acquisition volume, and we plan to continue to be selective in the current environment.
We continue to look at all material transactions in the market and we have plenty of capital to invest when we find opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We had an incredibly strong quarter on the third-party management front, adding 96 stores.
Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties.
It is worth mentioning that oftentimes, we are the buyer of these properties, and they are simply moving from one ownership category to another.
In the quarter, we purchased 11 of our managed stores in the REIT or in a joint venture for a total of 30 stores purchased from our third-party platform through September.
Fundamentals have remained even stronger than our already positive outlook, allowing us to raise our annual FFO guidance by $0.28 at the midpoint.
While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation, it has been less than our initial estimate of 300 basis points from this summer's peak.
Our revised guidance now assumes a 200 basis point moderation which would result in 2021 year-end occupancy generally similar to that of 2020.
We expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter to cap off what has been an incredible year for Extra Space Storage.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.
As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.85 per share, a year-over-year increase of 41.2%.
Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees.
As a result of our strong FFO growth, our Board of Directors raised our third quarter dividend an additional 25% after already raising it 11% earlier this year, a total increase of 38.9% over the third quarter 2020 dividend.
We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter, including a 3% savings in payroll, 42% savings in marketing and a 4% decrease in property taxes due to some successful appeals.
Despite the payroll savings we've enjoyed this year, like most companies, we've felt material wage pressure across all markets, including our corporate office.
Some of the payroll reduction has been the result of higher turnover and longer time to fill -- and longer time required to fill vacant positions.
We will experience continued payroll pressure in 2022 as we have raised wages to retain and recruit the best team in the storage industry.
This will also impact our G&A expense.
In the second quarter, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering.
And we completed a successful second offering in the third quarter, issuing another $600 million 10-year bond at a rate of 2.35%.
We also refiled our ATM in the quarter, and we have $800 million in availability.
Our access to capital has never been stronger.
And between net operating income and disposition proceeds, our leverage continues to be reduced.
Our quarter end net debt to EBITDA was 4.5 times, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities while maintaining our credit ratings.
Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions.
We raised our same-store revenue range to 12.5% to 13.5%.
Same-store expense growth was reduced to negative 1% to 0%, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 18% to 19.5%.
These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense.
We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.75 to $6.85 per share.
Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.12 to $0.11, even after adding a number of additional lease-up properties to our acquisition pipeline.
We are excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our team driving our growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio.
As we often say, it's a great time to be in storage.
