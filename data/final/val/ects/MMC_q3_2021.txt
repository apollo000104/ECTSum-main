I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.
Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman.
Marsh McLennan had another outstanding quarter.
Our third quarter results reflect strong momentum across all of our businesses.
Our continued strength represents a combination of the current environment as well as impressive day-to-day execution across the firm.
Although there continues to be uncertainty and volatility in the macro economic and geopolitical environment, we are seeing solid demand for our differentiated advice and solutions.
Even as COVID-19 continues to pose risks in many parts of the world, vaccine rollouts are having a positive impact.
We are taking advantage of opportunities to add to our deep venture world-class talent.
At the core of our business is a focus on our colleagues and we are dedicated to Marsh McLennan being an exciting and dynamic place to work for outstanding people.
And we continue to innovate and leverage the collective strengths of our organization to help clients address their most pressing concerns, including climate, diversity and inclusion, the future of work, cyber and digital strategies.
As we have discussed, 2021 represents Marsh McLennan's 150th year, and success over such a long period of time requires constant innovation and investment to deliver sustained growth and profitability.
I'd like to discuss just a few recent examples of how we are innovating to develop new unique client solutions.
Nick Studer leads our firmwide climate initiative.
We view climate as a significant opportunity, and we are well positioned to help clients with this critical issue.
In October, Oliver Wyman launched a Climate Action Navigator, drawing on insights from across the company.
This product helps public and private sector leaders plot a path through climate science, identifying emissions at the industry and regional level and quantifying the effects of multiple different carbon reduction technologies and actions.
We believe these tools will give business and government leaders vital insights to achieve their long-term climate goals and be a significant enabler of the transition to low carbon climate resilient investment in the corporate sector.
Mercer recently launched Skills-Edge, an innovative platform allowing employers to determine the most important skills for their future and design a talent strategy to assess, acquire, and retain them.
Skills-Edge provides quantitative insight into the demand and value of skills and supports both employees and organizations in rapidly reskilling for the future of work.
And just last week under the leadership of John Doyle, we launched our Cyber Risk Analytics Center.
This brings together cyber risk data and analytics expertise across our firm and provides clients with a comprehensive assessment of their cyber threats, existing and future controls, and the potential economic impact.
We are one enterprise, and these are just a few recent examples of how we bring together a leverage, knowledge and capabilities across the firm to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients and address their most pressing concerns.
We are a growth company as demonstrated by our track record.
Growth doesn't just happen.
It takes consistent vision, alignment, commitment and execution.
Since closing our acquisition of JLT, we've grown our total consolidated revenue by 27%, our adjusted earnings per share by 34% and our colleague base by 22%.
Achieving and sustaining growth requires consistent reinvestment in the business.
We always strive to balance delivering results in the short-term while investing for the long-term.
In 2021, we generated year-to-date adjusted earnings per share growth that is higher than any annual period in over three decades while at the same time investing for the future and making a significant press on hiring.
We grew our headcount year-to-date by nearly 5,000 or around 7%, mostly organic adds with an emphasis on client-facing roles.
We expect this influx of talent will drive growth, add to our capabilities and enhance our ability to serve clients.
Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions.
Many of the factors that drove the market to harden over the last few years continue, suggesting an inflection to a soft market is unlikely in the near-term.
The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 15% year-over-year consistent with second quarter.
This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace.
Looking at pricing by line.
The Marsh market index showed global property insurance was up 9%.
Global, financial and professional lines were up 32% driven in part by a near doubling in cyber rates, and global casualty rates were up high single-digits on average.
As a reminder, our index skews to large account business.
However, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well.
although less than for large complex accounts.
Measured and moderate rate increases in global property catastrophe reinsurance witnessed in the first half of 2021 could persist throughout the remainder of the year, reflecting adequate capacity offset by elevated global catastrophes, concerns around real and social inflation, and a continuation of large individual risk lawsuits.
2021 marks another year of significant catastrophe losses.
Hurricane Ida generated material losses in both the Southeast and Northeast.
This is in addition to a record level of flood losses in Europe, flooding in China and the continuation of wildfire losses in many parts of the world.
Marsh McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging market conditions and making a difference for them in the moments that matter.
Now let me turn to our terrific third quarter financial performance.
We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, which is up 32% versus a year ago, driven by strong top-line growth and continued low levels of T&E.
Total revenue increased 16% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis, the second consecutive quarter of record underlying growth in over two decades.
Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in Consulting.
Marsh grew 13% in the quarter on an underlying basis and benefited from strong new business and renewal growth.
Guy Carpenter grew 15% on an underlying basis in the quarter continuing its string of excellent results.

Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 25%, the second consecutive quarter in excess of 20%.
Overall, the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 19% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year.
Given our excellent third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are on track for a terrific year.
We expect to generate the best underlying revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth in over two decades and expand margins for the 14th consecutive year.
Our entire organization is on its front foot, focused and aligned, and this is evident in our excellent results.
Our results were outstanding with record third quarter revenue, second consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth, margin expansion, and significant earnings growth.

Our other net benefit credit was $69 million in the quarter and we expect it will remain at this level in the fourth quarter.
Investment income was $13 million in the quarter on a GAAP basis and $12 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio.
Interest expense in the third quarter was $107 million compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting lower debt levels in the period.
Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to be similar to the amount in the third quarter.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.4% compared with 26.5% in the third quarter last year.
Our GAAP tax rate was 24.2% in the third quarter, down from 30.3% in the third quarter of 2020 which was impacted by some unusual item.
Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24.6% last year.
Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021 excluding discrete items.
Given our year-to-date performance, we are on track for an outstanding year.
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, keep in mind the comparisons become more challenging given the rebound in growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We also continue to build for the long-term by investing in hiring.
While we are excited about the future benefits these investments will deliver, they come with upfront costs we absorb in the short-term.
That said, we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver exceptional results today while investing for the future and expect we will continue to do so.
Turning to capital management or balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with $10.7 billion of total debt.
Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when $500 million of senior notes mature.
We continue to expect to deploy at least $3.5 billion of capital in 2021, of which at least $3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.
The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.
Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion.
Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $665 million and included $272 million for dividends, $93 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases.

And operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.
