Actual results could vary materially from such statements.
Earnings for the quarter were $0.95 per share compared to $0.94 in the prior year quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.14 in the quarter compared to $1.33 in 2020.
Net sales in the quarter were up 34% from the prior year primarily due to increased volumes across all segments, favorable foreign currency translation, and the pass-through of higher material cost.
Segment income improved to $395 million in the quarter compared to $250 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales unit volumes including recovery in many locations affected by COVID in last year's second quarter.
As outlined in the release, we currently estimate third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of between $1.90 and $2 per share.
This estimate includes the results of the European Tinplate operations through August 31st.
We are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings guidance from $6.70 per share to $7.35 per share again assuming the sale of the Europe Tinplate business closes at the end of August.
Our expected adjusted tax rate for the full year remains at 24% to 25%.
Demand remained strong across all product lines, and geographies, and importantly the company continues to convert this growth into record earnings.
Average segment income from continuing operations over the last four quarters, or last 12 months June 2021 is approximately $100 million per quarter higher than the average of the four preceding quarters or LTM June 2020, with approximately $60 million of that income growth found in the Americas Beverage segment, clearly a step change in our earnings outlook.
We look forward to commercializing significant new capacity in the second half of this year into next to take the next step change up.
The results of the European Tinplate operations are now shown as discontinued.
Had the business been included in continuing operations, LTM June EBITDA would have approximated $2.1 billion.
Before reviewing the operating segments, we remind you that delivered aluminum in North America is approximately 65% higher today than at this time last year.
LME and delivery premium are contractual pass-throughs, so reported beverage revenues reflected both the volume increase, and the higher aluminum cost.
As last year's second quarter was the so called COVID quarter, we will also provide beverage growth percentages for the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2019 to give a bit more information perhaps relevance related to our beverage can unit volume growth.
In Americas Beverage demand remained strong across all the markets we serve with overall segment volumes up 18% compared to the second quarter of 2020.
First half '21 versus first half '19 volumes advanced 19%.
As described previously, we expect demand will continue to outweigh supply for the foreseeable future.
Commercial shipments from the first line of the company's new beverage can plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky commenced in June with shipments from the second line scheduled to begin in September.
The third line in Olympia, Washington and the second line in Rio Verde, Brazil are now scheduled for an early fourth quarter start-up.
As previously announced, the company will commercialize five new can lines in 2022.
New two line beverage can plants are being constructed in both Uberaba, Brazil; and Martinsville, Virginia along with a second can line being installed in Monterrey, Mexico.
Additionally the company announces today that it will construct a new two-line beverage can plant in the Southwestern United States with commercial shipments commencing late second quarter of 2023.
Customer commitments have already been secured for the plants' production capacity.
Unit volumes in European Beverage advanced 28% over the prior year second quarter, and 14% for the first half compared to the first half of 2019.
Income reflects contribution from the volume growth, which was recorded throughout the segment.
Asia-Pacific recorded 15% volume growth in the quarter, and 8% for the first half versus the first half of 2019, as most operations across Southeast Asia were able to grow despite numerous COVID lockdowns and movement control orders.
We do expect both Crown and customer operations to be subject to various and intermittent COVID lockdown measures throughout the balance of the year.
Commissioning will commence at the new plant in Vung Tau, Vietnam in September with customer shipments beginning in October.
Results in Transit Packaging were significantly higher than last year, and in line with our expectations, as strong demand for transit products and solutions mirrored the surge in overall industrial activity.
The business did well to navigate transportation delays, cost increases, and supply shortages, and is well-positioned for continued earnings growth as these conditions gradually ease.
We expect earnings growth in the back half of the year to approximately approximate first half growth.
Demand remained firm across North American food and aerosols along with the beverage can equipment making businesses.
In summary, a record first half for the company.
New capacity was commercialized during the quarter, and significant new capacity will be commissioned over the back half of the year.
Importantly, we continue to convert growth into expanded earnings and cash flow.
Segment income, and adjusted earnings in the first half up 50% to 60% over the prior year, and leverage at 3.6 times after repurchasing $300 million of company common stock is ahead of plan.
As Tom discussed, we have raised full year guidance, and the expected closing of the Tinplate sale still remains in the third quarter.
And with that Harley, we are now ready to take questions.
