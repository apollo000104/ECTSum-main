Before we begin our call today, I want to remind you that in order to talk about our company, we're going to mention a few things that are not historical facts.
These non-GAAP measures are adjusted net loss, adjusted net income, adjusted loss per share, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating loss, adjusted operating profit, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA.
We're using these non-GAAP measures today because they allow us to compare performance consistently over various periods without regard to non-recurring items.
In addition, RPC is required to use EBITDA to report compliance with financial covenants under our revolving credit facility.
Please review these disclosures if you're interested in seeing how they are calculated.

For the fourth quarter of 2019, revenues decreased to $236 million compared to $376.8 million in the prior year.

Fourth quarter 2019 capital expenditures were $41.4 million and the full-year total of $250.6 million and we currently estimate 2020 capex to be approximately $80 million.

Despite the challenging environment during 2019 and approximately $250 million of capital expenditures, we ended the year with $50 million in cash and no debt.
We will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and allocate capital to maximize long-term shareholder returns.
