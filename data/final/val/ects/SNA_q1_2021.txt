We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's chief executive officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's chief financial officer.
Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results.
As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion.
These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call.
Both can be found on our website.
As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter.
And along the way, I'll give you my perspective.
On our results, they are encouraging.
In our markets, they're standing firm and on our progress, it's made us stronger than ever before.
And we'll also speak about what it all means.
We believe it means we're getting better and better positioned for more, even while we're still in the midst of a once in a 100-year pandemic.
And after all that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.
We believe our first quarter is clear confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, further accommodating to the virus environment, overcoming period-to-period variations from business to business, dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement.
Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.0246 billion were up 20.2%, including $19.2 million of favorable foreign exchange and $11.3 million of acquisition-related sales.
Organic sales growth was 16.3%, gains in every group.
It's our third straight quarter of being above our pre-pandemic levels.
And ongoing contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation processes, the principles we use every day, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, they all combine to drive that progress.
Progress there was -- opco operating income of $200.9 million was up $62 million from last year, which included $7.5 million of restructuring charges.
Opco operating margin was 19.6%, up from the 2020 level of 16.3% or 17.2% as adjusted for restructuring.
For financial services, operating income of $65.3 million increased 14.8% and the delinquencies were down, even in the midst of a pandemic stress test, during commercial trial of what we could call extraordinary proportion.
And that result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 23.9%, a 300-basis-point improvement as reported and up 220 basis points as adjusted.
First-quarter earnings per share was $3.50, up 40.6% from last year's $2.40.
And excluding the 2020 restructuring charges, earnings per share grew 34.6%.
I said it before, and I'll say it again.
We believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered the Great Withering.
And we also believe that our first-quarter results testify to just that, especially when we compare them to 2019 before the virus.
So let's do that.
Versus 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew $102.9 million or 11.2%.
That reflects $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales; $11.6 million of favorable foreign; currency and a $76 million or 8.1% economic gain.
The 2021 opco operating margin of 19.6% was up 50 basis points from the 2019 level as adjusted for a legal settlement in that earlier period, and that 50-point gain was achieved against 80 points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while still absorbing the COVID.
Now to our markets.
Auto repair remains quite resilient.
The technicians are rolling.
They know they weather the depth of the COVID shock and have learned to accommodate the virus environment and are moving to psychological recovery.
There's still some air of vigilance, but their activities are robust.
And they know they won't be shocked again by a spike.
They're quite positive regarding the future of driving as people pivot from shared mobility to individual transportation, and it's vehicle repair with the technicians as a strong and resilient market.
You can hear it.
You can hear it in our franchisees' voices and you can see it written clearly across our double-digit numbers.
Also in auto repair, there are shop owners and managers.
There are signs that the auto business is rising.
Demand for new and new cars is high, but dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is still attenuated.
So there is a gradual gain and we're positioned to take advantage with the broader and stronger product line, with innovations like our TRITON-D10 diagnostics and new acquisitions like Dealer-FX putting us deeper into dealerships than ever before and providing us a clearer view of the future repair trends, new technologies, and evolving vehicle platforms.
Dealer-FX puts us at the right place at the right time as things change.
Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of consequence.
This is where C&I operates, the most international of our operations.
And these are the customers that have been most impacted by the virus.
They're slower to accommodate and to recover, but they have been recovering.
And in the quarter, the results showed that trend, despite some significant headwinds, including the continuing impact of the virus, the February freeze in Texas, some challenged business sectors like oil and gas, and troubled geographies like Southeast Asia.
Despite that variation, we did see growth in critical industries, improvement in a number of areas, in aviation, and education, and a heavy-duty fleet, they all combined to overcome the continuing turbulence in natural resources.
Also in C&I, SNA Europe, SNA Europe, another quarter of double-digit growth with broad strength across its geographies in places like France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Germany and the Nordic region.
And from our Asia Pacific division, up double digits as well with solid increases in key countries like China and India and Japan.
So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as improving and representing clear opportunity.
And coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there's clear overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding to repair shop owners and managers, extended critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product line, we're holding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work.
Understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-on people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock.
About a year ago, as we entered the virus, we recognize the resilience of our markets and the strength of our model, projecting a V recovery, and that's how it played out.
You can see it in the results.
So now let's turn to the segments and discuss those results.
In the C&I group, on a reported basis, including $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales, first-quarter volume rose 15.3% compared to last year.
Organic sales were up 9.5%, double-digit growth in our European hand tool business had a mid-single-digit rise and critical industries led the way.
From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable currency, represents a rise of $19.2 million, compared to the $31.5 million registered in 2020, which included $4.4 million of restructuring.
That all means, on an adjusted basis, an adjusted increase of over 40%, an as adjusted increase of over 40%, and the operating margin was 14.7% and as reported increase of 420 basis points and 290 as adjusted.
Now when compared with 2019, the pandemic-free measuring stick sales were up 7.2%, and that included $10 million or a 3.1% organic gain; $8 million of acquisitions, and $5.2 million for favorable foreign currency.
Once again, C&I demonstrated sequential improvement.
If you go back and look at the numbers, they keep getting closer and closer, now they're above pre-pandemic levels despite the ongoing uncertainty.
It's one of the things I think we want to remember, the virus isn't gone.
We're still bearing it and we didn't have it in 2019 and C&I is above that level.
As part of the trend, we remain committed to extending in critical industries.
That's the C&I sweet spot.
So we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise.
And enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products, developed especially to make critical work easier.
One example is our CT9010, 3/8-inch drive, 18-volt brushless impact wrench, the newest member of our MonsterLithium family, aimed at tight space sustained power, rugged durability, and precise control.
The 9010 features 320-pound feet of bulk breakaway torque and 240-pound feet of working torque, all the power of technician needs when they're working in confirmed quarters.
It offers a variable speed trigger in three-speed selections in Ford and reverse.
That means greater control, adaptable to any applications, and no overtorque-ing important.
The 9010 advanced design also reduces motor temperature rise, delivering higher durability and great power to rate ratio.
It's been fitted with 100-lumen headlight that helps technicians work in dark environment, just what's needed for those close jobs.
And the 18-volt battery with the five-amp hours ensures consistent output and extended the run time, which translates to less charging and more efficient workday.
And all of this comes -- and this is the best part, I think -- all of this comes in an extremely compact size.
Only six and three-quarter inches in overall length that will fit into the tightest of workspace.
The CT9010 is a great tool.
It's had strong demand, and it's already one of our $1 million hit products.
I don't want to leave C&I without mentioning SNA Europe.
Double-digit sales growth again, progress by the Black ergo tool management system, expanding product customization to the needs of the task, driving progress across -- against the twin headwinds of a difficult proven environment.
Europe is not so easy these days and the uncertainty of Brexit, no small feat.
Well, that's C&I, continuing sequential improvement and positioned for more.
Now on to the tools group.
Sales of $478.3 million, up $102.4 million, including $6.7 million of favorable currency and a $95.7 million or 25% organic gain, double-digit growth, both in the U.S. and the international operations.
The operating margin was 20.7%, yes, 20.7%, up 780 basis points.
Compared with pre-virus 2019, tools group sales grew $68.1 million, 16.6%, including $5.2 million favorable currency translation and $62.9 million or a 15.1% organic gain.
And this year's 20.7% operating margin was up 430 basis points compared with pre-pandemic 2019.
The tools group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it.
We do believe our runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise network represents a continuing opportunity.
And there's evidence that we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel in our franchisee metrics, the financial and physical indicators that we monitor closely.
Again, this quarter, they remain clearly favorable.
And based on those metrics, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger.
And they say so.
And our direct interactions at events like this past January's kickoff meeting held this year at a distance.
It was a great affair.
Well attended, strong orders, visible commitment to our brand, watch parties all over the country.
I zoomed into several of myself, and they were brimming with enthusiasm and optimism.
Our franchisees entrepreneurs and professionals all are pumped, confident, and reaching higher.
The tools group quarter that's a strong advantage for us.
The tools group quarter was also marked with Snap-on value creation, customer connection, and innovation, offering new products.
Sometimes, just an improvement on an established line, but clearly making work easier, solving problems, delivering productivity gains.
All of these are born out of observing the changing work in shops on an everyday basis.
We're in those shops every day.
We watch the work.
We author the products.
One such add is our KERN681, seven-drawer, single bank EPIQ series roll cab, configured entirely with extrawide 62-inch drawers, greater flexibility and capacity and a standard footprint, making the most of limited shop space.
Our franchisees are already calling an uninterrupted storage.
It's the first large-capacity roll cab with a full complement of extrawide drawers in the industry.
It's made on our Iowa plant.
I saw some of them being made there just last month.
The local team is proud of them.
It comes with two swivels and two rigid casters located right on the corners of the box.
It doesn't seem like much of a change, but that's a clever innovation that provides mobility and tight spaces, while also greatly enhancing box stability.
That's a very important feature for a high-capacity unit, the KER681 EPIQ strength, styling, and styling, 8,000 pounds of low capacity, and more than 45,000 cubic inches of storage space.
The franchisees are saying it's been a clear hit and they're right.
We spent some time over several quarters, working to expand franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and Van operations, so it's paid off.
Selling capacity is up.
And you can see it clearly in the three straight gangbusters quarters for our tools group.
I don't need to say any more about them.
Now let's speak about RS&I.
First-quarter organic sales rose 7.6% with varying gains across the board.
Undercar equipment coming back, delivering double-digit rise, diagnostics and information products, independent repair shops, growing at mid-single digits.
And the business focused on OEM dealerships are advancing low single digits.
Operating earnings of $81.4 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.1 million from 2020, which included $3.1 million of restructuring costs.
Compared with 2019, sales grew $19.7 million or 6%, including a $10 million or 3.1% organic gain, $7.3 million from acquisitions, and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency.
We clearly see the potential and our runways for growth in the RS&I group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products.
Advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, are active and passive aids to keep vehicle passengers safe, things like collision avoidance, lane departure warnings, automatic parking, and crosswind stabilization.
These new features are great.
But what's really music to our ears is that they require periodic calibrations to make sure they're working with precisions, and calibrations can be complicated.
Sensors and cameras vary considerably across vehicle makes and models.
And if you get a faulty recalibration, it leads to rework and it's not good for safety.
So our new John Bean 2.80 of calibration system is the fix, making sure the vehicle is physically aligned correctly, guiding calibration of the sensors, and documenting that the procedure was formed appropriately.
And it does so for the multitude of mix and model seen regularly in OEM and aftermarket shops.
The new Tru-Point is easy to use.
It requires minimal training.
It compensates for the floor irregularities that are so common in garages and bedevils alignment and calibration.
It's quick and efficient and it's OEM compliant.
It's a powerful product right in the crosshairs of automated vehicle technology that's so prominent today.
Progress in diagnostics and information with independent repair shop owners and managers was also clearly evident in our diagnostics business and our RS&I activity.
And in this quarter, the launch of the new TRITON-D10 handheld helped author that positive.
The new TRITON is ultrafast, a two-second boot-up, and it has a best-in-class 10-inch touchscreen.
It's geared to the more capable technician, offering a one-touch full diagnostic cold scan scope capabilities for performance display and guided testing of suspect components that you may want to replace, but you want to make sure there's the problem.
It's loaded with our Fast Track intelligence diagnostics rooted in our proprietary database of over 200 billion vehicle events, a Snap-on only feature that enables quick and accurate diagnosis of even the most difficult and unusual repairs, ensuring an efficient and effective solution for those very, very time-consuming problems.
Just what the capable and senior technician needs.
Now as I've said, we've spent said before, we spent considerable effort working to help franchisees sell the complex tools of today efficiently.
And it's paying off with TRITON.
Following that initial instruction, the demo unit could then be put immediately in the hands of a technician to physically showcase the great benefits of our powerful new tool and it worked.
The launch has been a success.
Our franchisees are comfortable selling new and complex tool, and many are now calling the TRITON-D10 the best diagnostic unit ever.
Finally, RS&I got a nice boost in the quarter, as often as the case by new technologies and OEM dealerships, helped by some significant essential tools and equipment programs supporting the new electric vehicle launches.
We're quite positive about RS&I's future with repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves.
It plays to our strength.
So that's the highlights of the quarter, continued in strong progress.
Our third straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels; C&I, sequential improvement, sequential advancement; RS&I is solid; the tools group, strong and pumped; organic sales rising 16.3%; opco operating margin, 19.6%; EPS, $3.50 a big rise and most important, most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when we entered.
It was an encouraging quarter.
Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6.
The first quarter of 2021 exhibited robust financial performance, particularly as compared to last year when we experienced the initial shock of the virus.
The quarter's results also compared favorably with the first quarter of 2019, which being a prepandemic time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline.
Net sales of $1.0246 billion in the quarter increased 20.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 16.3% organic sales gain, $11.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $19.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
Additionally, net sales in the period increased 11.2% from $921.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, including an 8.1% organic gain, $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $11.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
Consolidated gross margin of 50.1% and compared to 49.5% last year, which included 60 basis points from restructuring costs.
The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes will benefit from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.5% improved 270 basis points from 33.2% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs.
The improvements primarily reflect the impact of higher sales and cost containment actions, partially offset by higher stock-based costs and 30 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions.
Operating earnings before financial services of $200.9 million compared to $138.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 44.6% year-over-year improvement.
As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.6% improved 330 basis points from 16.3% last year, which included 90 basis points for restructuring costs.
Financial services revenues of $88.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $85.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $65.3 million increased $8.4 million from 2020 levels, principally due to the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses.
Last year's provisions included a $2.6 million charge for higher reserves, resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19.
Consolidated operating earnings of $266.2 million increased 36% from $195.8 million last year.
As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 23.9% compared to 20.9% in 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring costs.
Excluding the restructuring costs, operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 220 basis points from last year.
Our first-quarter effective income tax rate of 23.5% compared to 24.2% last year, which included a 10 basis point increase related to the prior-year quarter's restructuring charges.
Finally, net earnings of $192.6 million or $3.50 per diluted share increased $55.4 million or $1.01 per share from 2020 levels, representing a 40.6% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Additionally, net earnings increased $14.7 million or $0.34 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Net earnings in 2020 included restructuring charges of $6 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share, and net earnings in 2019 included a benefit of $8.7 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share from a legal settlement.
Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share of $3.50 in 2021 increased 34.6% from 2020 and 16.3% from 2019 levels.
Now let's turn to our segment results.
Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $345.7 million increased 15.3% from $299.9 million last year, reflecting a 9.5% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
The organic gain includes double-digit increases in the segment's European-based and tools business and Asia Pacific operations as well as a mid-single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries.
Improvements in year-over-year sales growth were widely seen across Europe as well as in most emerging markets.
Additionally, within Critical Industries, strong sales gains were achieved in aviation, heavy-duty and technical education, while year-over-year declines in the natural resources sector improved from those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020, but continue to lag pre-pandemic sales levels.
As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 7.2% from 2019 levels, representing a 3.1% organic sales gain, $8 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
Gross margin of 38.7% improved 190 basis points from 36.8% in the first quarter of 2020, which included 150 basis points from restructuring charges.
Aside from the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring costs, contributions from higher sales volumes were partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved 230 basis points as compared to last year, primarily as a result of the higher volumes and savings from cost containment actions.
Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $31.5 million last year, the operating margin of 14.7% compared to 10.5% a year ago.
Turning now to Slide 8.
Sales of Snap-on tools group of $478.3 million increased 27.2% from $375.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 25% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations.
Net sales in the period increased 16.6% from $410.2 million in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting a 15.1% organic sales gain and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
Gross margin of 45.9% in the quarter improved 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.2% improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions.
Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $98.9 million, compared to $48.6 million last year, the operating margin of 20.7%, compared to 12.9% a year ago, an increase of 780 basis points.
Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9.
Sales of $347.6 million compared to $314.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7.6% organic sales gain, $4 million of acquisition-related sales and $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
The organic increase includes a double-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment, a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a low single-digit gain in activity with OEM dealerships.
As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased 6%, reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
Gross margin of 46% declined from 47.9% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
As a reminder, undercar equipment as well as facilitation program-related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment's average.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.6% improved 70 basis points from 23.3% last year, which included 80 basis points of restructuring cost.
Excluding the effects of restructuring benefits from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by 80 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions.
Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $81.4 million compared to $77.3 million last year.
The operating margin of 23.4%, compared to 24.6% a year ago.
Now turning to Slide 10.
Revenue from financial services of $88.6 million compared to $85.9 million last year.
Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million compared to $56.9 million in 2020.
Financial services expenses of $23.3 million decreased to $5.7 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses resulting from $2.4 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge-offs and the absence of the previously mentioned first-quarter 2020 $2.6 million charge.
As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1.4% in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In the first quarter, the average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% in 2021, compared to 17.7% in 2020.
The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9%.
The lower yield on contract receivables in 2021 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees.
These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment.
As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $11 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding.
Total loan originations of $261.8 million in the first quarter increased $6.2 million or 2.4% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 1.7% increase in originations of finance receivables while originations of contract receivables were up 5.7%.
Moving to Slide 11, our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation.
Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio decreased $25.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in net collections.
The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for the United States extended credit is down 10 basis points from the first quarter last year and down 20 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
We believe this reflects the typical seasonal delinquency pattern that customarily results in a decline in the first quarter, followed by increases later in the year, usually peaking in the fourth quarter where we compete with the technicians holiday-related discretionary spending.
As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.9 million represented 2.55% of outstandings at quarter end, down seven basis points sequentially and down 44 basis points as compared to the same period last year.
Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $319.3 million in the quarter increased $105.9 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $32.1 million decrease in inventory.
Net cash used by investing activities of $207.2 million included $200 million for the acquisition of dealer FX and the capital expenditures of $19.3 million, partially offset by net collections of finance receivables of $12.1 million.
Free cash flow during the quarter of $312.1 million was 158% in relation to net earnings.
Net cash used by financing activities of $131 million included cash dividends of $66.7 million and the repurchase of 722,000 shares of common stock from $151.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plan of $93 million.
As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $268.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations.
Turning to Slide 13.
Trade and other accounts receivable increased $10.1 million from 2020 year end.
Days sales outstanding of 62 days, compared to 64 days at 2020 year end.
Inventories decreased $16.4 million from 2020 year end and on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020.
Our quarter-end cash position of $904.6 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020.
Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 12.4% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020.
In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities.
As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
That concludes my remarks on our first-quarter performance.
I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021.
We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million.
tax legislation, our full-year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.
Well, that's our first quarter.
Another encouraging period, resilient markets through the shock and on the way to psychological recovery.
The third straight quarter of upward trajectory, clear year-over-year achievement and the third straight quarter of results exceeding the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.
The RS&I sales continuing upward with OI margins of 23.4%, attenuated but still strong.
C&I, ongoing sequential growth across the world and OI margins 14.7%, up nicely even from 2019.
And then the tools group.
Sales up organically, 25% versus 2020, up in all product lines and in all geographies, volume up 15.1% versus 2019 and an OI margin of 20.7%.
Finally, financial services in the midst of the greatest stress test, profits up, delinquencies down, rock solid.
And it all came together with Snap-on sales rising organically 16.3% versus 2020 and 8.1% versus '19.
OI margin, 19.6%, up significantly despite the virus, the unfavorable currency and the acquisition impacts.
And the EPS, $3.50, a substantial rise versus both 2020 and 2019.
We do believe that Snap-on is abundant opportunity as the COVID recedes, and the world shifts away from the cities and away from share transportation and as new vehicle technologies make the car park more complex.
And we further believe that we are stronger today than when we entered the storm our advantages of product, brand and people are even greater, and we're in a favorable position to wield those strengths, realize the opportunities and continue our positive trajectory throughout 2021 and beyond.
I want you to know that your work in this withering has made a difference to our company and to our society.
For your efforts in keeping our world and its critical mobility and tact, you have my admiration.
For your contribution to our progress in this first quarter, you have my congratulations.
