Today, we reported all-time record quarter results with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.79, an increase of 207% compared to last year.
These outstanding results were driven by strong performance in new, used and customer financial services and disciplined expense management.
Demand continues to exceed supply for new vehicles, and we expect this to continue through 2021 in part due to the production disruption.
More importantly, low interest rates and consumer preference for vehicle ownership versus ridesharing and public transportation are supporting demand.
We expect our shipments from the manufacturers to double in the second quarter compared to the prior year.
AutoNation same-store new vehicle units were up 22% year-over-year and up 12% compared to 2019.
