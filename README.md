# ECTSum: A New Benchmark Dataset For Bullet Point Summarization of Long Earnings Call Transcripts

Long Paper Accepted at the <b> EMNLP 2022 Main Conference! </b> <br /> 

## Dataset
The <b> <i> ECTSum </b> </i> dataset can be found under the `data` folder.

## Codes
Codes and instructions for our proposed model <b> <i> ECT-BPS </b> </i> can be found under `codes/ECT-BPS` <br />
Codes and instructions for our baseline models can be found under `codes/baselines`
